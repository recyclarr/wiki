## Linux & macOS Installation

:::info Before You Start

If you follow these instructions, the following tools are required.

`tar`, `xz`, `wget`

:::

Copy the URL to the specific download you want in the table above. Use this URL in the following
command. You can even put this URL in your `~/.bashrc` or similar to set it every time you log in.

```bash
export RECYCLARR_URL="Paste_URL_Here"
```

With the above variable set, run the command below to download & install/upgrade. The `--overwrite`
option is necessary for upgrades so that the command may replace any existing `recyclarr` binary.

```bash
wget "$RECYCLARR_URL" -O - | sudo tar xJ --overwrite -C /usr/local/bin
```

:::info

It is recommended to install Recyclarr to `/usr/local/bin` because, on most platforms, this path is
already in `$PATH` by default. This allows you to use the `recyclarr` command without much fuss. You
are, of course, welcome to install Recyclarr anywhere you want.
