Various scenarios supported using flexible configuration structure:

import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';

<TOCInline toc={toc} />

## Update as much as possible in both Sonarr and Radarr with a single config

Create a single configuration file (use the default `recyclarr.yml` if you want to simplify your CLI
usage by not being required to specify `--config`) and put all of the configuration in there. This
example refers to sensitive values by [using a `secrets.yml` file](/reference/secrets).

```yml
sonarr:
  sonarr_main:
    base_url: !secret sonarr_url
    api_key: !secret sonarr_apikey
    quality_definition:
      type: series
    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          # Unwanted
          - 85c61753df5da1fb2aab6f2a47426b09 # BR-DISK
          - 9c11cd3f07101cdba90a2d81cf0e56b4 # LQ
          - e2315f990da2e2cbfc9fa5b7a6fcfe48 # LQ (Release Title)
          - 47435ece6b99a0b477caf360e79ba0bb # x265 (HD)
          - fbcb31d8dabd2a319072b84fc0b7249c # Extras
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: WEB-1080p

radarr:
  radarr_main:
    base_url: !secret radarr_url
    api_key: !secret radarr_apikey
    quality_definition:
      type: movie
      preferred_ratio: 0.5
    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
        # HQ Release Groups
        - ed27ebfef2f323e964fb1f61391bcb35 # HD Bluray Tier 01
        - c20c8647f2746a1f4c4262b0fbbeeeae # HD Bluray Tier 02
        - 5608c71bcebba0a5e666223bae8c9227 # HD Bluray Tier 03
        - c20f169ef63c5f40c2def54abaf4438e # WEB Tier 01
        - 403816d65392c79236dcb6dd591aeda4 # WEB Tier 02
        - af94e0fe497124d1f9ce732069ec8c3b # WEB Tier 03
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: HD
```

Even though it's all in one file, Radarr settings are ignored when you run `recyclarr sync sonarr`
and vice versa. To update both use `recyclarr sync` (without the positional argument).

## Adding additional qualities to a template

Scenario: *I want to use a pre-built Recyclarr template for Sonarr, but would like to add additional
qualities to the profile.*

Solution:

There are two options. The first is to disable the quality profile include in the template, which
will stop it from syncing:

```yml
sonarr:
  web-1080p-v4:
    base_url: !secret sonarr_url
    api_key: !secret sonarr_apikey

    include:
      # Comment out any of the following includes to disable them
      - template: sonarr-quality-definition-series
      # - template: sonarr-v4-quality-profile-web-1080p (commented out so disabled)
      - template: sonarr-v4-custom-formats-web-1080p
```

Qualities can then be managed directly in Sonarr.

The second option is to write a new `quality_profile`, and add it to the template:

```yml
sonarr:
  web-1080p-v4:
    base_url: !secret sonarr_url
    api_key: !secret sonarr_apikey

    include:
      # Comment out any of the following includes to disable them
      - template: sonarr-quality-definition-series
      - template: sonarr-v4-quality-profile-web-1080p
      - template: sonarr-v4-custom-formats-web-1080p

    quality_profiles:
      - name: WEB-1080p
        qualities:
          - name: WEB 1080p
            qualities:
              - WEBDL-1080p
              - WEBRip-1080p
          - name: Bluray-1080p
          - name: Bluray-720p
```

You must include **all** qualities that you want to be present in the quality profile. This is
because `quality_profile`s [replace] those from a referenced include.

[replace]: /reference/configuration/include#detail-qualities

## Synchronize a lot of custom formats for a single quality profile

Scenario: *I want to be able to synchronize a list of custom formats to Radarr. In addition, I want
the scores in the guide to be applied to a single quality profile.*

Solution:

```yml
radarr:
  main:
    base_url: !secret radarr_url
    api_key: !secret radarr_apikey

    custom_formats:
      # Advanced Audio from the guide
      - trash_ids:
          - 496f355514737f7d83bf7aa4d24f8169 # TrueHD ATMOS
          - 2f22d89048b01681dde8afe203bf2e95 # DTS X
          - 417804f7f2c4308c1f4c5d380d4c4475 # ATMOS (undefined)
          - 1af239278386be2919e1bcee0bde047e # DD+ ATMOS
          - 3cafb66171b47f226146a0770576870f # TrueHD
          - dcf3ec6938fa32445f590a4da84256cd # DTS-HD MA
          - a570d4a0e56a2874b64e5bfa55202a1b # FLAC
          - e7c2fcae07cbada050a0af3357491d7b # PCM
          - 8e109e50e0a0b83a5098b056e13bf6db # DTS-HD HRA
          - 185f1dd7264c4562b9022d963ac37424 # DD+
          - f9f847ac70a0af62ea4a08280b859636 # DTS-ES
          - 1c1a4c5e823891c75bc50380a6866f73 # DTS
          - 240770601cc226190c367ef59aba7463 # AAC
          - c2998bd0d90ed5621d8df281e839436e # DD
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: HD
```

## Manually assign different scores to multiple custom formats

Scenario: *"I want to synchronize custom formats to Radarr or Sonarr. I also do not want to use the
scores in the guide for some of the CFs. Instead, I want to assign my own distinct score to some
custom formats in a single quality profile."*

Solution:

```yml
radarr:
  main:
    base_url: !secret radarr_url
    api_key: !secret radarr_apikey

    custom_formats:
      # Take scores in the guide for these 3
      - trash_ids:
          - 3cafb66171b47f226146a0770576870f # TrueHD
          - dcf3ec6938fa32445f590a4da84256cd # DTS-HD MA
          - a570d4a0e56a2874b64e5bfa55202a1b # FLAC
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: Ultra-HD

      # Assign manual scores to the 3 below CFs, each added to the same profile
      - trash_ids: [496f355514737f7d83bf7aa4d24f8169] # TrueHD ATMOS
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: Ultra-HD
            score: 100
      - trash_ids: [2f22d89048b01681dde8afe203bf2e95] # DTS X
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: Ultra-HD
            score: 200
      - trash_ids: [417804f7f2c4308c1f4c5d380d4c4475] # ATMOS (undefined)
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: Ultra-HD
            score: 300
```

The configuration is structured around assigning multiple custom formats the same way to just a few
quality profiles. It starts to look more redundant and ugly when you want fine-grained control over
the scores, especially if its on a per-single-custom-format basis.

## Assign custom format scores the same way to multiple quality profiles

You can assign custom format scores (from the guide) to multiple profiles (all the same way):

```yml
radarr:
  main:
    base_url: !secret radarr_url
    api_key: !secret radarr_apikey

    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          - 496f355514737f7d83bf7aa4d24f8169 # TrueHD ATMOS
          - 2f22d89048b01681dde8afe203bf2e95 # DTS X
          - 417804f7f2c4308c1f4c5d380d4c4475 # ATMOS (undefined)
          - 1af239278386be2919e1bcee0bde047e # DD+ ATMOS
          - 3cafb66171b47f226146a0770576870f # TrueHD
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: HD
          - name: Ultra-HD
```

Quality profiles named `HD` and `Ultra-HD` will all receive the same scores for the same custom
formats.

You can also choose to override the score (for all custom formats!) in one profile:

```yml
radarr:
  main:
    base_url: !secret radarr_url
    api_key: !secret radarr_apikey

    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          - 496f355514737f7d83bf7aa4d24f8169 # TrueHD ATMOS
          - 2f22d89048b01681dde8afe203bf2e95 # DTS X
          - 417804f7f2c4308c1f4c5d380d4c4475 # ATMOS (undefined)
          - 1af239278386be2919e1bcee0bde047e # DD+ ATMOS
          - 3cafb66171b47f226146a0770576870f # TrueHD
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: HD
            score: 100 # This score is assigned to all 5 CFs in this profile
          - name: Ultra-HD # Still uses scores from the guide
```

## Scores in a quality profile should be set to zero if it wasn't listed in config

Scenario: *"I want only the custom formats I assign to a quality profile to be assigned scores.
Scores for other custom formats, **including those I manually assign**, should be reset back to
zero."*

```yml
radarr:
  main:
    base_url: !secret radarr_url
    api_key: !secret radarr_apikey

    quality_profiles:
      - name: HD
        reset_unmatched_scores:
          enabled: true

    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          # - a570d4a0e56a2874b64e5bfa55202a1b # FLAC (commented out so disabled)
          - 2f22d89048b01681dde8afe203bf2e95 # DTS X
          - 3cafb66171b47f226146a0770576870f # TrueHD
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: HD
          - name: Ultra-HD
```

Let's say you have three custom formats added to Radarr: "FLAC", "DTS X", and "TrueHD". Since only
two are listed in the `trash_ids` array ("FLAC" is commented out, so it is disabled), what happens
to "FLAC"? Since two quality profiles are specified above, each with a different setting for
`reset_unmatched_scores`, the behavior will be different:

- The `HD` quality profile will always have the score for "FLAC" set to zero (`0`).
- The `Ultra-HD` quality profile's score for "FLAC" will never be altered.

The `reset_unmatched_scores` setting basically determines how scores are handled for custom formats
that exist in Radarr but are not in the list of `trash_ids` in config. As shown in the example
above, you set it to `true` which results in unmatched scores being set to `0`, or you can set it to
`false` (or leave it omitted) in which case Recyclarr will not alter the value.

Which one should you use? That depends on how much control you want Recyclarr to have. If you use
Recyclarr to supplement manual changes to your profiles, you probably want it set to `false` so it
doesn't clobber your manual edits. Otherwise, set it to `true` so that scores aren't left over when
you add/remove custom formats from a profile.

## What does the file structure look like with multiple YAML configuration files? {#yaml-structure}

Suppose you want to use `recyclarr.yml` and multiple YAML files in the `configs` directory, as
documented on [the File Structure page](/guide/file-structure#default-yaml). What would that file
structure look like?

Using docker as an example, it would look like this:

```txt
.
└── config/
    ├── cache/
    ├── repo/
    ├── configs/
    │   ├── radarr.yml
    │   └── sonarr.yml
    ├── includes/
    │   ├── radarr_include.yml
    │   └── sonarr_include.yml
    └── recyclarr.yml
```

In the above example:

- Recyclarr will load the `recyclarr.yml` file in `config/`, as well as both YAML files in
  `configs/`.
- Each YAML file may contain any number of Radarr and/or Sonarr instances.
- The names of the YAML files under `configs/` can be whatever you want.
- The YAML files under `includes/` are not loaded, but can be [referenced].

[referenced]: /reference/configuration/include#config

## Merge multiple config templates into a single file with a single instance {#merge-single-instance}

Use case: You have multiple template files, created from `recyclarr config create --template`. You
want all of those files to be merged into a single YAML file (e.g. `recyclarr.yml`). Instead of
multiple instances, you want all configuration to be for a single (the same) instance.

:::info

Examples below are for Radarr, but the process is the same for Sonarr as well.

:::

Let's say you start with two files.

`remux-web-1080p.yml`:

```yml
radarr:
  radarr_hd:
    base_url: !secret radarr_hd_url
    api_key: !secret radarr_hd_apikey

    quality_definition:
      type: movie

    quality_profiles:
      - name: Remux + WEB 1080p
        reset_unmatched_scores:
          enabled: true

    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          - 0f12c086e289cf966fa5948eac571f44  # Hybrid
          - 570bc9ebecd92723d2d21500f4be314c  # Remaster
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: Remux + WEB 1080p
```

`uhd-bluray-web.yml`:

```yml
radarr:
  radarr_uhd:
    base_url: !secret radarr_uhd_url
    api_key: !secret radarr_uhd_apikey

    quality_definition:
      type: movie

    quality_profiles:
      - name: UHD Bluray + WEB
        reset_unmatched_scores:
          enabled: true

    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          - e23edd2482476e595fb990b12e7c609c  # DV HDR10
          - 58d6a88f13e2db7f5059c41047876f00  # DV
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: UHD Bluray + WEB
```

Merging these files is a little bit involved. You can't just move whole blocks of YAML into another
file. The sections directly under the instance name (e.g. `uhd-bluray-web`) need to be merged
together without duplicating them. For example, don't introduce a second `quality_profiles:` block.
Combine the contents to form a single section. Also note that some sections, like
`quality_definition`, cannot be merged. If the two files use a different quality definition, you
must choose one or the other.

The final merged file would look like below.

```yml
radarr:
  radarr_merged:
    base_url: !secret radarr_merged_url
    api_key: !secret radarr_merged_apikey

    quality_definition:
      type: movie

    quality_profiles:
      - name: UHD Bluray + WEB
        reset_unmatched_scores:
          enabled: true
      - name: Remux + WEB 1080p
        reset_unmatched_scores:
          enabled: true

    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          - e23edd2482476e595fb990b12e7c609c  # DV HDR10
          - 58d6a88f13e2db7f5059c41047876f00  # DV
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: UHD Bluray + WEB

      - trash_ids:
          - 0f12c086e289cf966fa5948eac571f44  # Hybrid
          - 570bc9ebecd92723d2d21500f4be314c  # Remaster
        assign_scores_to:
          - name: Remux + WEB 1080p
```

What was done:

- `quality_definition` (in this case) both happened to use `movie`, so we simply left this one
  alone.
- `quality_profiles` was combined. We added the element from the first file into the existing
  sequence.
- `custom_formats` was combined similar to `quality_profiles`.
