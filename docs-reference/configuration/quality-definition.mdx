    quality_definition:
      type: series
      preferred_ratio: 0.5
      qualities:
        - name: Bluray-1080p

```

**Optional.** *Default: No quality definitions are modified*

Specify information related to quality definition processing here. Only the following child
properties are permitted. If not specified, no quality definitions will be synced.

## `type` {#qd-type}

**Required.**

A quality definition type found by using the [`list qualities` command][listqualities]. The type
specified here identifies the quality size settings that should be parsed and uploaded to your
Sonarr or Radarr instance.

## `preferred_ratio` {#qd-preferred-ratio}

**Optional.** *Default: use guide values*

A value `0.0` to `1.0` that represents the percentage (interpolated) position of that middle slider
you see when you enable advanced settings on the Quality Definitions page in Radarr or Sonarr. A
value of `0.0` means the preferred quality will match the minimum quality. Likewise, `1.0` will
match the maximum quality. A value such as `0.5` will keep it halfway between the two.

:::info Behavioral Notes

- Any value less than `0` or greater than `1` will result in a warning log printed and the value
  will be clamped.
- Using this property on a Sonarr v3 instance does nothing, since older versions of Sonarr only have
  min/max values and no preferred.

:::

## `qualities` {#qd-qualities}

**Optional.** *Default: use guide values for all qualities*

Override size limits for specific qualities instead of using the guide values. This is useful when
you want to keep most guide recommendations but need different limits for certain quality levels.

Each entry in the array requires a `name` and can optionally specify `min`, `max`, and/or
`preferred`. Any property you omit keeps the guide's default value for that quality.

```yml
quality_definition:
  type: movie
  qualities:
    - name: Bluray-1080p
      min: 5
      max: 100
      preferred: 80
    - name: WEBDL-1080p
      max: unlimited
      preferred: unlimited
```

### `name` {#qd-qualities-name}

**Required.**

The quality name to override. Must match a quality that exists in the guide for the selected `type`.
Names are case-insensitive. Use the [`list qualities` command][listqualities] to see available
quality names.

### `min` {#qd-qualities-min}

**Optional.** *Default: guide value*

Minimum size in MB per minute of runtime. Must be a number `0` or greater.

### `max` {#qd-qualities-max}

**Optional.** *Default: guide value*

Maximum size in MB per minute of runtime. Accepts a number `0` or greater, or the keyword
`unlimited` to allow any file size.

### `preferred` {#qd-qualities-preferred}

**Optional.** *Default: guide value*

Preferred size in MB per minute of runtime. Accepts a number `0` or greater, or the keyword
`unlimited` to prefer the largest available file.

:::warning Validation Rules

- Size values must satisfy: `min` ≤ `preferred` ≤ `max`
- If a quality name doesn't exist in the guide, Recyclarr terminates with an error
- The `unlimited` keyword resolves to the service-specific maximum limit
