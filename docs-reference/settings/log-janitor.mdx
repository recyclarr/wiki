description: Configure automatic cleanup of old log files
---

The log janitor is responsible for cleaning up logs generated by Recyclarr each time a command is
executed. These settings allow the user to alter the default cleanup behavior. For example, you may
want logs to be cleaned up sooner or keep log files around longer.

```yml
log_janitor:
  max_files: 20
```

- `max_files` *(Default: `20`)*<br/>
  The maximum number of log files to keep. If there are more log files than the max allowed here,
  Log Janitor will remove the oldest log files.
