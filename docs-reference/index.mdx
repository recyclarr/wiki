This section contains the complete reference documentation for Recyclarr's configuration files.

## Configuration Reference

The **Configuration** section documents all properties available in your `recyclarr.yml` file. This
is where you define what gets synced to your Radarr and Sonarr instances.

## Settings Reference

The **Settings** section documents the `settings.yml` file, which controls Recyclarr's own behavior
such as notifications and repository sources.
