title: File Structure

This page describes the general file structure used by Recyclarr for its data. Many of these are
platform-specific.

## Application Data Directory {#appdata-directory}

The application data directory is the root location for Recyclarr's files. Everything that Recyclarr
reads or writes, by default, starts with this path.

| Platform | Location                                  |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | `%APPDATA%\recyclarr`                     |
| Linux    | `~/.config/recyclarr`                     |
| MacOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/recyclarr` |
| Docker   | `/config`                                 |

## Default YAML Configuration Files {#default-yaml}

Configuration files may be located in multiple places, each documented in the sections that follow.
For all supported locations, the following behavior applies:

- All methods may be used together and all corresponding YAML files will be loaded.
- You don't have to use all locations; you can choose only the ones you want to use.
- If at least one configuration file is not found, it will result in an error.

### File: `recyclarr.yml` {#recyclarr-yaml}

The default YAML configuration file is named `recyclarr.yml` and it is always located in the
application data directory (listed above based on platform). Example (using docker path):

```txt
/config/recyclarr.yml
```

### File: `settings.yml` {#settings-yaml}

Settings in this file affect the behavior of Recyclarr regardless of instance-specific
configuration for Radarr and Sonarr. Example (using docker path):

```txt
/config/settings.yml
```

### Directory: `configs` {#config-directory}

:::note Version Requirement

This functionality requires `v3.0.0` or greater!

:::

Under the application data directory, there is a subdirectory named `configs` in which you can place
any number of YAML files. All files must have the `.yml` extension in order to be recognized. Every
single YAML file placed here will be loaded as if every file were specified in the `--config`
command line argument.

This system works especially well in Docker, where you don't really have an easy way to specify
custom CLI arguments.
