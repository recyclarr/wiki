Command line interface (CLI) documentation for the `recyclarr` executable.

## Terminology

- **Command**: A sub-category of functionality that defines its own options and arguments, such as
  `sync` and `list`.
- **Option**: Looks like `-f` (short form) or `--foo` (long form) and is never required.
- **Argument**: A positional value that is either required or optional (e.g. In `recyclarr sync
sonarr`, `sonarr` is an argument of the `sync` command)

:::info

If you see a section title with a pipe character (`|`) in it, like `-d|--debug`, that means that
option has both a short *and* long form. So you can specify `-d` or `--debug`.

Headings for argument-based parameters can be enclosed in either square-brackets (e.g. `[optional]`)
or angle-brackets (e.g. `<required>`).
