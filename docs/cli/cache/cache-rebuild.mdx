## Usage {#usage}

```txt
recyclarr cache rebuild [resource] [OPTIONS]
```

## Description {#description}

Rebuilds cache mappings by matching configured resources to existing resources in the service by
name. This is useful when:

- Cache was accidentally deleted or corrupted
- Migrating Recyclarr to a new machine
- Relocating a Sonarr/Radarr instance to a new URL
- Fixing incorrect cache mappings caused by case-variant names in the service
- Adopting manually-created custom formats into Recyclarr management

The command matches your configured custom formats (from YAML) against custom formats in the service
using case-insensitive name matching. It does not process custom formats that aren't in your
configuration.

## Examples {#examples}

```sh
# Preview what cache rebuild would do for all instances
recyclarr cache rebuild --preview

# Rebuild cache for a specific instance
recyclarr cache rebuild -i my-radarr

# Rebuild cache with verbose output showing all cache states
recyclarr cache rebuild --verbose

# Rebuild cache and adopt manually-created CFs that match by name
recyclarr cache rebuild --adopt

# Rebuild only custom format cache entries
recyclarr cache rebuild custom-formats
```

## Arguments {#arguments}

### `[resource]` {#resource}

The resource type to rebuild cache for. If omitted, all resource types are processed.

Valid values:

- `custom-formats` - Rebuild custom format cache mappings

## Options {#options}

Visit [Common Options](../common.mdx) to read about options usable by all commands.

### `-i|--instance` {#instance}

One or more instance names to process. Can be specified multiple times to process specific
instances. If omitted, all instances defined in your configuration are processed.

```bash
# Process two specific instances
recyclarr cache rebuild -i my-radarr -i my-sonarr
```

### `-p|--preview` {#preview}

Show what changes would be made to the cache without actually saving them. Use this to verify the
rebuild results before committing changes.

### `-v|--verbose` {#verbose}

Show detailed output including cache file paths and per-item state information. Useful for
troubleshooting or understanding exactly what the command is doing.

### `--adopt` {#adopt}

Take ownership of existing custom formats in the service that match configured custom formats by
name. Use this when you have manually created custom formats that you want Recyclarr to manage going
forward.

Without this option, custom formats that exist in the service but aren't in the cache are reported
as "Not in service" (meaning they would be created on the next sync). With `--adopt`, these are
added to the cache so Recyclarr will update them instead of creating duplicates.

## Output {#output}

The command displays results grouped into two sections:

**Changes** (cache modifications made):

- **Added** - New cache entries created for CFs found in service
- **Corrected** - Cache entries updated with correct service ID
- **Removed** - Stale entries deleted (service CF no longer exists)

**Summary** (informational, no cache change):

- **Unchanged** - Cache entries already correct
- **Not in service** - Configured CFs not found in service (will be created on next sync)
- **Preserved** - Non-configured cache entries kept for deletion tracking
- **Ambiguous** - Multiple service CFs match the same name (error condition)

## Ambiguous Matches {#ambiguous-matches}

If the service contains multiple custom formats with the same name (differing only in case, such as
"HULU" and "hulu"), the command reports an ambiguous match error. To resolve this, you must manually
delete or rename the duplicate custom formats in Sonarr/Radarr so each name is unique.
