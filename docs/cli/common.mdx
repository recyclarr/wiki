## Options

These are options shared by *all* commands.

### `-h|--help`

Print help output. Help is also context-aware, so you can get help output specific to any command.
For example, `recyclarr sync -h` will print help specific to the `sync` command.

### `--log [LEVEL]` {#log-arg}

Enable log output mode. When used, Recyclarr switches from interactive UI output to traditional log
output (the same format written to log files). This is useful for scripts, automation, or debugging.

Valid levels:

- `debug` - Show debug, info, warning, and error messages
- `info` - Show info, warning, and error messages (default)
- `warn` - Show only warning and error messages

When used without a level argument (`--log`), defaults to `info`.

:::info Output Modes

Recyclarr has two mutually exclusive output modes:

- **Interactive mode** (default): Shows progress bars, tables, and formatted output. No logs are
  printed to console (but still written to log files).
- **Log mode** (`--log`): Shows traditional log output. Interactive UI elements are disabled.
