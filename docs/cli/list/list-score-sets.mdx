## Usage

```txt
recyclarr list score-sets <service>
```

## Description

For a specific service, this command prints a list of all available score sets from the TRaSH
Guides in a formatted table. A "score set" is a preset collection of scores across multiple custom
formats designed for specific types of quality profiles, such as 1080p vs 2160p.

These score set names can be used with the [`score_set` property][scoresetyaml] in your quality
profile configuration.

## Examples

```bash
# List all score sets for Radarr
recyclarr list score-sets radarr

# List all score sets for Sonarr
recyclarr list score-sets sonarr
```

## Arguments
