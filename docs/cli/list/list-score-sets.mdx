## Usage

```txt
recyclarr list score-sets <service>
```

## Description

For a specific service, this command prints a list of all available score sets from the TRaSH
Guides. A "score set" is a preset collection of scores across multiple custom formats designed for
specific types of quality profiles, such as 1080p vs 2160p.

Here is an example of the output you will see:

```txt
List of Score Sets in the TRaSH Guides:

              anime-radarr
              anime-sonarr
              default
              sqp-1-1080p
              sqp-1-2160p
              sqp-1-uhd
              sqp-2
              sqp-3
              sqp-4
              sqp-5
              streaming-services-anime-optional
              streaming-services-only-optional
```

These score set names can be used with the [`score_set` property][scoresetyaml] in your quality
profile configuration.

## Examples

```bash
# List all score sets for Radarr

# List all score sets for Sonarr

```
