## Usage

```js
recyclarr list qualities <service> [OPTIONS]
```

## Description

For a specific service type, print a list of all available types of quality definitions. The "type"
of a quality definition comes from JSON files in the guide and this type is used in the
configuration YAML for the `quality_definition` property:

```yml
quality_definition:
  type: series
```

Above, `series` would only be valid if that type appeared in the list output by `recyclarr list
qualities sonarr`.

## Arguments

### `<service>` {#service}

A required positional argument that indicates the specific service type to list qualities for. Valid
values for this argument are:

- `radarr`: List [Radarr qualities][radarr]
- `sonarr`: List [Sonarr qualities][sonarr]

[radarr]: https://github.com/TRaSH-/Guides/tree/master/docs/json/radarr/quality-size
