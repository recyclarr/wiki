## Terminology {#terms}

### Recyclarr-Specific Terms {#recyclarr-terms}

- **Include Template**<br/>
  A type of template that may _only_ be included.

- **Config Template**<br/>
  A type of template that may _only_ be used as a configuration file. It _cannot_ be included. May
  be created with the `config create` command.

- **Include Directive**<br/>
  A specific method of including a YAML file (e.g. `config: myfile.yml`). The [reference
  docs][includeref] contain a comprehensive list of all include directives.

[includeref]: /yaml/config-reference/include.mdx

### YAML-Specific Terms {#yaml-terms}

Most of these definitions were taken verbatim from the [official YAML glossary][yamlglossary]. This
list of terms is not comprehensive. It only touches on terms that are relevant to understanding
Recyclarr's include YAML merge behavior.

- **Sequence**<br/>
  A _sequence_ is a collection that is an ordered list of 0 or more nodes.

  ```yml
  - one
  - two
  - three
  ```

- **Mapping**<br/>
  A _mapping_ is a collection that consists of a set of 0 or more key/value pairs. In YAML, both the
  key and the value can be any kind of node.

  ```yml
  one: "one value"
  two: 2
  three: "3"
  ```

- **Scalar**<br/>
  A _scalar_ is a node that consists of a single value unit. Strings, numbers and boolean values are
  examples of scalar nodes. In the example below, the value `true` is considered a scalar value.

  ```yml
  delete_old_custom_formats: true
  ```

## Include YAML Schema {#schema}

Unlike configuration files, YAML that is included uses a simplified schema (structure). Normally, in
a typical configuration file, you have a structure like this:

```yml
radarr:
  instance_name:
    base_url: http://localhost:7878
    api_key: the_key

    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          - id1
          - id2
```

Since included YAML is only capable of adding information to _specific instance configurations_,
they do not contain a service type (e.g. `radarr`) or an instance name (e.g. `instance_name`). If we
convert the above example into a YAML file that may be included, it would look like this:

```yml
custom_formats:
  - trash_ids:
      - id1
      - id2
```

You essentially start an include file as if it's everything under `instance_name`. The properties
`base_url` and `api_key` have been omitted for reasons described later.

## Include Precedence {#precedence}

Recyclarr handles includes using the following rules:

1. Includes are processed from top to bottom, in order. Configuration is merged using specific
   strategies discussed in the sections [Merge Behavior](#behavior) and [Merge
   Reference](#reference).
1. The root configuration is merged into the final, aggregated include configuration data. Root
   configuration YAML always takes precedence over included YAML.

## Merge Behavior {#behavior}

Merge behavior is described in terms of two sides: `A` and `B`. Side `A` typically represents the
_current merged state_ of the included YAML at any point. Side `B` is the YAML data to include next.

As Recyclarr visits each node in included YAML, it decides what to do based on the following logic.

1. If `B` has a node but not `A`, then it takes the node from `B`.
1. Otherwise, if `A` has a node but not `B`, then it takes the node from `A`.
1. Otherwise, if both sides (`A` and `B`) have the same node, then a pre-determined _Merge
   Operation_ is used.

Recyclarr uses _Merge Operations_ to decide how to aggregate (combine/merge) YAML data that exists
in two YAML files. These operations are important to understand as they are used in the [Merge
Reference](#reference) section that follows.

Before getting into the specifics of each operation, it's important to understand some YAML-specific
terminology. See the [Terminology](#yaml-terms) section to learn more.

### Add {#add}

This merge operation involves concatenating two _sequences_ together. As such, it only applies to
sequences. The end result is `B` is simply appended to `A`. The example below demonstrates the
behavior for the sequences under `custom_formats`.

```yml
# A
custom_formats:
  - trash_ids:
      - 496f355514737f7d83bf7aa4d24f8169  # TrueHD Atmos
      - 2f22d89048b01681dde8afe203bf2e95  # DTS X

# B
custom_formats:
  - trash_ids:
      - 570bc9ebecd92723d2d21500f4be314c  # Remaster
      - eca37840c13c6ef2dd0262b141a5482f  # 4K Remaster
      - e0c07d59beb37348e975a930d5e50319  # Criterion Collection

# A + B
custom_formats:
  - trash_ids:
      - 496f355514737f7d83bf7aa4d24f8169  # TrueHD Atmos
      - 2f22d89048b01681dde8afe203bf2e95  # DTS X
  - trash_ids:
      - 570bc9ebecd92723d2d21500f4be314c  # Remaster
      - eca37840c13c6ef2dd0262b141a5482f  # 4K Remaster
      - e0c07d59beb37348e975a930d5e50319  # Criterion Collection
```

### Join {#join}

A join involves two _sequences_ of _mappings_. Based on some key, such as a `name` property, two
sequences are joined together. If sequence `B` has a key that matches any key in sequence `A`, then
those two mappings are _combined_ (see [Union](#union)). For mappings in sequence `B` that have _no
match_, the behavior is effectively the same as [Add](#add).

```yml
# A
quality_profiles:
  - name: Bluray|WEB-1080p
    score_set: anime-radarr

# B
quality_profiles:
  - name: Bluray|WEB-1080p
    min_format_score: 1000
  - name: Remux + WEB 1080p
    min_format_score: 0

# A + B
quality_profiles:
  - name: Bluray|WEB-1080p
    min_format_score: 1000
    score_set: anime-radarr
  - name: Remux + WEB 1080p
    min_format_score: 0
```

### Union {#union}

A _union_ involves combining two _mappings_ together. Matching properties (keys) in the mapping have
their own merge operations that might be a [replace](#replace), [add](#add), [join](#join), or
another union (recursive). It depends on the type of the nodes (properties) and which merge
operation is [assigned to that node](#reference).

```yml
# A
quality_definition:
  type: movie

# B
quality_definition:
  preferred_ratio: 0.5

# A + B
quality_definition:
  type: movie
  preferred_ratio: 0.5
```

### Replace {#replace}

A _replace_ operation results in `B` completely overwriting (replacing) `A`. This can happen to any
YAML node type, but typically applies to _scalars_.

```yml
# A
delete_old_custom_formats: true

# B
delete_old_custom_formats: false

# A + B
delete_old_custom_formats: false
```

## Merge Reference {#reference}

This section documents the _merge operation_ used for all configuration values. Note that this first
table just covers top-level properties for instance configuration. If nested properties have merge
semantics, those will be documented in later sections. This will especially be the case for
[union](#union) operations.

### Unsupported Properties {#unsupported}

The following properties are **not supported** for inclusion. If these properties are present in
included YAML data, you will usually see a warning message printed to the console.

- `base_url`
- `api_key`
- `include`

## Merge Details {#details}

Some properties (nodes) require further explanation to understand the reason why they use a
particular merge operation. Each of the sub-sections here provide those explanations. There are
links from the Merge Reference tables to these sections as well.

### Quality Profile Qualities {#detail-qualities}

Even though `qualities` is a YAML Sequence, it uses a Replace merge operation. The reason for that
has to do with the fact that qualities are very "high-stakes". This means that changes to your
qualities have the ability to impact your entire media library. So it's important to make sure that
include directives don't make your qualities list difficult or confusing to get right. While
Recyclarr certainly could support some sort of "Join" / "Add" combination of behavior for the list
of qualities, doing so would not only be confusing but very error-prone.

If two lists of qualities were combined together, the user would not have the ability to specify the
relative ordering of those qualities. "Add" merge operations are a simple "A \+ B" concatenation.
That is to say, qualities you add would simply be appended to the bottom of the list. You couldn't
order them any other way.

So, even though a "Replace" operation may yield more redundancy (you have to specify qualities from
an included YAML that you otherwise don't care about), it's _safer_ because you can see the entire
list of qualities in one place _and_ can ensure the ordering is exactly as you expect.

### Custom Formats {#detail-cfs}

The primary purpose of using a _Join_ merge operation for `custom_formats` is to facilitate user
overrides of custom format scores that come from included YAML files. The join operates on quality
profile names as the _key_.

If a custom format is assigned to the same quality profile on both side `A` and `B`, the CF on side
`A` is removed from the `custom_formats` list and the version on side `B` is kept. This ensures that
whatever score is set (or not set, if the user wanted the default instead) acts as an override.

To demonstrate this behavior, see the example below which involves two files: `include.yml` and
`config.yml`.

```yml
# include.yml
custom_formats:
  - trash_ids:
      - abc
      - xyz
    assign_scores_to:
      - name: profile1
      - name: profile2

# config.yml
include:
  - config: include.yml

custom_formats:
  - trash_ids:
      - abc
    assign_scores_to:
      - name: profile1
        score: 50
```

After the two files above are merged, the `custom_formats` list will effectively be:

```yml
custom_formats:
  - trash_ids:
      - xyz
    assign_scores_to:
      - name: profile1
      - name: profile2

  - trash_ids:
      - abc
    assign_scores_to:
      - name: profile2

  - trash_ids:
      - abc
    assign_scores_to:
      - name: profile1
        score: 50
```
