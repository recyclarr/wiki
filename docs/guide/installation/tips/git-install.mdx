title: Install Git on Windows
---

This guide will walk you through the process of installing Git on Windows. Git is essential for
running Recyclarr, as it's used to download and update the application.

## Quick Start

For those familiar with package managers, you can quickly install Git using one of the following
methods:

- Using [Winget CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win):

  ```cmd
  winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
  ```

- Using [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/git):

  ```cmd
  choco install git
  ```

If you prefer a more guided approach or don't use package managers, continue reading for detailed
instructions using the official Git installer.

## Detailed Installation Guide

### Using the Git for Windows Installer

:::info

Skip this section if you've already installed Git using Winget or Chocolatey.

:::

1. Download the official [Git for Windows installer](https://gitforwindows.org/).

2. Before running the installer, close any open terminal windows (PowerShell, CMD, etc.). This is
   important because the installer will modify your `PATH` environment variable, and open terminals
   won't reflect these changes.

3. Run the downloaded installer.

4. During the installation wizard, you can keep all options at their default settings for a standard
   installation.

5. Pay special attention to the following page in the wizard:

   ![Git Setup Add Path](/doc-img/git-setup-add-path.png)

   Ensure that the option "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" is selected.
   This should be the default choice.

6. Complete the installation process.

### Verifying the Installation

After installation, you can verify that Git is correctly installed by opening a new terminal window
and running:

```cmd
git --version
```

If Git is properly installed, this command will display the installed version of Git.

## Next Steps

With Git successfully installed, you're now ready to use Recyclarr. If you haven't already, check
out our [Getting Started](../../getting-started.mdx) guide to begin using Recyclarr.

:::tip

Remember to always use a new terminal window after installing Git to ensure that your system
recognizes the new installation.
