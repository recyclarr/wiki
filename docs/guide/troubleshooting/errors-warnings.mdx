title: Errors & Warnings
---

This page documents warnings and errors you might see in your console output or logs. These are
usually caused by configuration issues or something else within the user's control to fix.

## Configuration

<details>
<summary>
Error: No configuration YAML files found
</summary>

Recyclarr could not find any YAML configuration files to load *or* files specified were missing.
There are three ways to provide configuration data:

1. Via the `recyclarr.yml` file.
1. One or more YAML files in the `configs` directory.
1. Paths to YAML files provided via the `--config` command line argument.

When using the CLI, the files provided *must* exist. To solve this error, use one of the above
methods to provide your YAML configuration. See the documentation about [default YAML
configuration][default-yaml] for more information. There is also [an
example](/reference/config-examples#yaml-structure) showing multiple configuration files
and their structure.

[default-yaml]: ../file-structure.mdx#default-yaml

<details>
<summary>
Error: Incompatible value assigned/used at line 7: Invalid cast from 'System.String' to
'Recyclarr.TrashLib.Config.Services.QualityDefinitionConfig'
</summary>

As of version 4.0.0, the syntax for `quality_definitions` changed. You must manually change to the
new format. See [the v4 release notes](../upgrade-guide/v4.0.mdx).

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Error: Cutoff must be an allowed quality or group
</summary>

When syncing quality profiles, you may see this HTTP 400 error from Sonarr or Radarr:

```txt
Cutoff must be an allowed quality or group
```

This occurs when your quality profile uses a `qualities` list but doesn't specify `until_quality`.
Recent versions of Sonarr (4.0+) and Radarr (5.26+) require this field, and it must reference a
quality that exists in your `qualities` list.

Add `until_quality` to your quality profile configuration:

```yml
quality_profiles:
  - name: My Profile
    until_quality: Bluray-1080p
    qualities:
      - name: Bluray-1080p
      - name: WEB 1080p
```

See the [until_quality reference](/reference/configuration/quality-profiles#until-quality) for more
details.

</details>

## Custom Formats

<details>
<summary>
Tip: Unexpected custom formats or changes appearing
</summary>

If you notice custom formats in Sonarr/Radarr that aren't in your Recyclarr configuration, or
settings changing unexpectedly, check if you're running multiple sync tools on the same service.

Tools like Notifiarr, Buildarr, or manual API scripts can conflict with Recyclarr. **Pick one sync
tool and disable the others.** Running multiple tools that modify the same Sonarr/Radarr instance
will cause unpredictable behavior.

<details>
<summary>
Warning: Custom format with trash ID e23edd2482476e595fb990b12e7c609c is duplicated in quality
profile SD with conflicting scores: 1000 vs 500
</summary>

This situation is caused by specifying a custom format more than once under the same Quality
Profile. The conflicting scores are shown in the warning message to assist you with debugging the
problem.

The below YAML is an example of what will cause this warning.

```yml
custom_formats:
  - trash_ids:
      - e7718d7a3ce595f289bfee26adc178f5 # Repack/Proper
      - e23edd2482476e595fb990b12e7c609c # DV HDR10
    assign_scores_to:
      - name: SD
        score: 1000
  - trash_ids:
      - e23edd2482476e595fb990b12e7c609c # DV HDR10
    assign_scores_to:
      - name: SD
        score: 500
```

Above, you can see that "DV HDR10" (Trash ID `e23edd2482476e595fb990b12e7c609c`) is specified
*twice* for the same quality profile named `SD`. The solution to this warning is to remove one of
the two custom formats. In this case, to demonstrate the solution, I'll remove the copy that is
assigned a score of `1000`:

```yml
custom_formats:
  - trash_ids:
      - e7718d7a3ce595f289bfee26adc178f5 # Repack/Proper
    assign_scores_to:
      - name: SD
        score: 1000
  - trash_ids:
      - e23edd2482476e595fb990b12e7c609c # DV HDR10
    assign_scores_to:
      - name: SD
        score: 500
```

</details>

## API & Connection

<details>
<summary>
Error: Response could not be deserialized to JSON
</summary>

When communicating with Radarr or Sonarr, you may see an error like this:

```txt
Response could not be deserialized to JSON: GET http://hostname:7878/api/v3/customformat
```

This typically means your Base URL is missing from the URL you specified in the YAML. For example,
if you access Radarr at `http://hostname:7878/radarr`, your configuration should include the
`/radarr` path:

```yml
radarr:
  my-instance:
    base_url: http://hostname:7878/radarr
    api_key: your_api_key
```

See [issue #42](https://github.com/recyclarr/recyclarr/issues/42) for more details.

## Docker {#docker}

A series of troubleshooting steps for docker-specific issues.

### Permission Issues

The `/config` volume is very sensitive to user changes in the container. For example, if you first
run the container using `user: 1000:1000` and then run a second time using `user: 1500:1500`, you
are likely to get errors. This is because files that Recyclarr creates are owned by the user & group
you specify. Not all files can be used by multiple users.

If you change your user and/or group IDs, it is your responsibility to update the ownership of files
in the `/config` volume so that they match the UID and GID you are specifying. This can be done
through the `chown` command and may require root permissions on your host system.

## Non-Docker {#non-docker-errors}

The troubleshooting steps documented here are for the non-docker version of Recyclarr (running it
directly on a host machine). The [Docker](../installation/docker.mdx) page has troubleshooting steps
as well.

<details>
<summary>
Error: Failed to create CoreCLR, HRESULT: 0x8007000E
</summary>

This means "Out of Memory". Ensure you have enough memory on your system. If you do, try setting the
`DOTNET_GCHeapHardLimit` environment variable to `10000000` and try again.

<summary>
Error: Attempted to read or write protected memory (macOS Apple Silicon)
</summary>

On macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4), you may see intermittent crashes with this error:

```txt
System.AccessViolationException: Attempted to read or write protected memory.
This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt.
```

This is a [known .NET runtime bug][dotnet-issue] affecting ARM64 Macs, not a Recyclarr issue
([#454][recyclarr-issue]). The crash is intermittent and timing-dependent.

**Workarounds:**

- **Retry the command** - Users report approximately 70% success rate on v7.5+. Simply run the
  command again until it succeeds.
- **Use Docker** - Docker runs on Linux and is unaffected by this macOS-specific bug.

The bug is tracked for fix in .NET 11.

<summary>
Error: Failed to map file / A fatal error occurred while processing application bundle
</summary>

On Mac or Linux OS, you may see the following error when you run `recyclarr`:

```txt
Failed to map file. open(/Users/foo/Downloads/recyclarr) failed with error 13
Failure processing application bundle.
Couldn't memory map the bundle file for reading.
A fatal error occurred while processing application bundle
```

This cryptic message is actually a permissions error, likely because your executable does not have
read permissions set. Simply run `chmod u+rx recyclarr` to add read + execute permissions on the
`recyclarr` executable.
