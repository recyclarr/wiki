## Summary

The synchronization cache in Recyclarr allows it to more accurately detect changes to custom formats
in the TRaSH guides. This mainly helps cover changes done on the \*arr side, like renames.

Once Recyclarr creates or updates a custom format in \*arr, it records information about it in a
cache file located in the `cache` subdirectory under the main app data location. The [location
varies][app-data] depending on platform.

:::info

The cache files are not meant to be edited by users. In general I recommend leaving them alone.
Recyclarr will manage it for you.

## Relocating Server Instances {#relocating}

Sometimes users relocate an instance of Radarr or Sonarr. They then update the `base_url`
configuration property to have Recyclarr communicate with that service at its new location.

Recyclarr uniquely identifies an instance by its `base_url` value. If the hostname, port, path,
scheme, or any other part of the URL changes (including adding or removing a trailing slash!),
Recyclarr will no longer use the previous cache data and instead will create a new one. This often
results in confusion because users start to see this error:

> [ERR] Custom Format 'CRiT' (Trash ID: 16622a6911d1ab5d5b8b713d5b0036d4) cannot be synced because
> another CF already exists with that name (ID: 246). To adopt the existing CF, run: recyclarr cache
> rebuild --adopt

This happens because Recyclarr no longer believes it owns that CF, even though it created it before
the `base_url` changed. To recover, run the [cache rebuild][cache-rebuild] command with the
`--adopt` flag:

```bash
recyclarr cache rebuild --adopt
```

This rebuilds the cache by matching your configured custom formats to existing ones in the service
by name. The `--adopt` flag tells Recyclarr to take ownership of matching CFs. After rebuilding,
Recyclarr will recognize the CFs it previously created and resume managing them normally.
