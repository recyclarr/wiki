Features have been removed *or* behavior changed. Most of the items here would have been deprecated
in the past. Deprecations are always mentioned in release notes for feature releases.

## Dedicated Includes Directory {#include-dir}

The root directory for relative local include paths has changed. Previously, relative paths provided
to the [`config` include directive][include-config] were rooted in `${appdatadir}/configs`. Putting
includes in the `configs` directory is no longer supported. Going forward, all includes should
reside in `${appdatadir}/includes`.

Migrating to the new directory is simple. Simply cut & paste any subdirectories containing include
template YAML files to the new `includes` subdirectory. Assume you have the current structure:

```txt
.
├── configs/
│   ├── config1.yml
│   ├── config2.yml
│   └── local/
│       ├── my-include1.yml
│       └── my-include2.yml
└── includes/
```

An empty top-level `includes` will be created for you by Recyclarr. In the example above, we need to
move the `local` directory to this top-level `includes` directory. The final structure should look
like this:

```txt
.
├── configs/
│   ├── config1.yml
│   └── config2.yml
└── includes/
    └── local/
        ├── my-include1.yml
        └── my-include2.yml
```

By doing this, the relative paths in your `templates` section does not need to change:

```yml
include:
  - config: local/my-include1.yml
  - config: local/my-include2.yml
```

### Recommended File Structure Changes (Optional) {#rec-structure-change}

If you followed the recommended file structure for your includes, then chances are you already have
a `configs/include` directory. To avoid having the path look weird, such as
`includes/include/my-include1.yml`, it is recommended that you remove the intermediate `include`
directory or rename it. For example, you could change this:

```yml
include:
  - config: include/my-include1.yml
  - config: include/my-include2.yml
```

To:

```yml
include:
  - config: my-include1.yml
  - config: my-include2.yml
```

And have your filesystem change from:

```txt
.
├── configs/
│   ├── config1.yml
│   └── config2.yml
└── includes/
    └── include/
        ├── my-include1.yml
        └── my-include2.yml
```

To this:

```txt
.
├── configs/
│   ├── config1.yml
│   └── config2.yml
└── includes/
    ├── my-include1.yml
    └── my-include2.yml
```

## YAML: Custom Formats `quality_profiles` Renamed {#assign-scores-to}

Prior to this major release, two `quality_profiles` nodes existed in YAML:

- The top-level version, which defined quality profiles to sync
- The one under `custom_formats`, which instructed Recyclarr which profile the CF scores should be
  synced to.

The fact that `quality_profiles` existed in two places with distinct meanings created a lot of
confusion, especially in support channels. Starting with this major release, `quality_profiles`
under `custom_formats` must be changed to `assign_scores_to`.

Before v8.0, if you had YAML like this:

```yml
radarr:
  movies:
    base_url: http://localhost:7878
    api_key: 123abc

    quality_profiles:
      - name: SD

    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          - ed38b889b31be83fda192888e2286d83 # BR-DISK
          - 90cedc1fea7ea5d11298bebd3d1d3223 # EVO (no WEBDL)
        quality_profiles:
          - name: HD-1080p
          - name: HD-720p
            score: -1000
      - trash_ids:
          - 496f355514737f7d83bf7aa4d24f8169 # TrueHD ATMOS
          - 2f22d89048b01681dde8afe203bf2e95 # DTS X
        quality_profiles:
          - name: SD
```

You are required to change it to this:

```yml
radarr:
  movies:
    base_url: http://localhost:7878
    api_key: 123abc

    quality_profiles:
      - name: SD

    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          - ed38b889b31be83fda192888e2286d83 # BR-DISK
          - 90cedc1fea7ea5d11298bebd3d1d3223 # EVO (no WEBDL)
        assign_scores_to: # <<< RENAMED
          - name: HD-1080p
          - name: HD-720p
            score: -1000
      - trash_ids:
          - 496f355514737f7d83bf7aa4d24f8169 # TrueHD ATMOS
          - 2f22d89048b01681dde8afe203bf2e95 # DTS X
        assign_scores_to: # <<< RENAMED
          - name: SD
```

Refer to the `RENAMED` comments in the above example for exact lines that changed.

## Settings: Repository Configuration Replaced {#resource-providers}

The legacy `repositories` configuration format has been completely removed and replaced with the new
`resource_providers` system. This change provides support for multiple repositories per content
type, local directory support, and enables future extensibility.

### Old Format (Removed)

```yml
repositories:
  trash_guides:
    clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
    branch: master
    sha1: c611e9df00bf9261bddfc749219295fe189ae552
  config_templates:
    clone_url: https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates.git
    branch: master
```

### New Format

```yml
resource_providers:
  - name: trash-guides
    type: trash-guides
    clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
    reference: c611e9df00bf9261bddfc749219295fe189ae552
    replace_default: true

  - name: config-templates
    type: config-templates
    clone_url: https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates.git
    reference: master
    replace_default: true
```

### Key Changes

| Old                                                     | New                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Nested structure (`trash_guides:`, `config_templates:`) | Flat list with explicit `type` property     |
| `branch` and `sha1` properties                          | Unified `reference` property                |
| Implicit replacement of official sources                | Explicit `replace_default: true` required   |
| Single repository per type                              | Multiple repositories per type supported    |
| Git repositories only                                   | Local directories also supported via `path` |

### Migration Notes

- **No `repositories` config?** No changes needed - official sources are included automatically
- **Had custom repositories?** Add `type` property and use `replace_default: true` if you want to
  replace official sources, or omit it to use your repository as a supplement
- **Using forks?** Consider using supplemental providers instead of replacing official sources -
  this lets you get official updates while adding your customizations

See the [Resource Providers][resource-providers] documentation for complete configuration details.

## YAML: `replace_existing_custom_formats` Removed {#replace-existing-removed}

The `replace_existing_custom_formats` option has been removed. Custom format sync now uses ID-first
matching: if a custom format is in the state, Recyclarr trusts that tracked ID regardless of name
changes in the service.

To adopt manually-created custom formats into Recyclarr management, use the state repair command:

```bash
recyclarr state repair --adopt
```

This adds existing custom formats (matched by name) to the state. After adoption, Recyclarr will
update them on subsequent syncs.

Remove `replace_existing_custom_formats` from your configuration - it is no longer recognized.

## CLI: `--debug` Option Removed {#debug-removed}

The `-d|--debug` option has been removed. Use `--log debug` instead.

**Before:**

```bash
recyclarr sync --debug
```

**After:**

```bash
recyclarr sync --log debug
```

The `--log` option enables log output mode and accepts three levels: `debug`, `info` (default), and
`warn`. See the [CLI Common Options][common-log] documentation for details.

## CLI: `list score-sets` Command {#score-sets-command}

The `--score-sets` flag on `list custom-formats` has been replaced with a dedicated subcommand.

**Before:**

```bash
recyclarr list custom-formats radarr --score-sets
```

**After:**

```bash
recyclarr list score-sets radarr
```

## CLI: List Command Output Format {#list-output-format}

List commands now display formatted tables instead of plain text. The global `--raw` option has been
removed and is now specific to list commands, outputting TSV (tab-separated values) format for
scripting.

**Before (v7.x):**

```txt
List of Custom Formats in the TRaSH Guides:

          - b124be9b146540f8e62f98fe32e49a2a # 1.0 Mono
          - 820b09bb9acbfde9c35c71e0e565dad8 # 1080p
```

**After (v8.0):**

List commands display formatted tables with category groupings and helpful instructions. Use `--raw`
for machine-readable TSV output suitable for scripting.

### Migration for Scripts {#list-scripts}

If you have scripts that parse list command output, update them to use `--raw`:

```bash
recyclarr list custom-formats radarr --raw
```

The `--raw` option outputs TSV format. Each list command documents its specific column format in the
[CLI reference][list-commands].

## Config Templates Changes {#config-templates}

### Version-Aware Branch Selection {#version-aware-templates}

Config-templates providers now use version-aware branch selection. Recyclarr automatically selects
the `v{major}` branch matching your version (e.g., `v8` for Recyclarr 8.x), falling back to
`master`/`main` if unavailable. This ensures template compatibility with your Recyclarr version.

No user action is required. If you have an explicit `reference` in your settings, it continues to
override auto-detection.

### v7 Templates Maintenance Policy {#v7-maintenance}

With the introduction of version-aware branches, v7 templates (the `master` branch) are now in
maintenance mode:

- **No new features**: v7 templates will not receive updates for new guide changes
- **Critical fixes only**: Only severe issues will be addressed on the v7 branch
- **Template drift expected**: v7 templates may diverge from current TRaSH Guides recommendations

**If you're experiencing template drift from the guides**: The recommended path is upgrading to
Recyclarr v8, which uses the `v8` branch with actively maintained templates.

v8 templates are being simplified to leverage guide-backed quality profiles and custom format
groups, providing better alignment with the TRaSH Guides while reducing configuration complexity.

## Environment: `RECYCLARR_APP_DATA` Removed {#app-data-removed}

The `RECYCLARR_APP_DATA` environment variable has been removed. If it is set, Recyclarr exits with
the following error:

```txt
RECYCLARR_APP_DATA is no longer supported. Use these instead:
  - RECYCLARR_CONFIG_DIR: User configuration (replaces APP_DATA)
  - RECYCLARR_DATA_DIR: Ephemeral data (optional, defaults to CONFIG_DIR)

To migrate, rename RECYCLARR_APP_DATA to RECYCLARR_CONFIG_DIR in your
environment.
```

### Migration {#app-data-migration}

Rename `RECYCLARR_APP_DATA` to `RECYCLARR_CONFIG_DIR` in your environment, shell profile, Docker
Compose file, or systemd unit.

**Before:**

```bash
export RECYCLARR_APP_DATA="/path/to/appdata"
```

**After:**

```bash
export RECYCLARR_CONFIG_DIR="/path/to/appdata"
```

Optionally, set `RECYCLARR_DATA_DIR` to a separate path if you want to keep ephemeral files
(resources, logs) out of your backup. If unset, data files remain in the config directory as before.

See the [Environment Variables][env-vars] reference for full details.

## CLI: `--app-data` Option Removed {#app-data-cli-removed}

The `--app-data` CLI option has been removed. Use the [`RECYCLARR_CONFIG_DIR`][env-config]
environment variable instead.
