title: File Structure
---

This page describes the directory structure used by Recyclarr. Recyclarr separates its files into
two root directories: a **configuration directory** for user data that should be backed up, and a
**data directory** for ephemeral files that can be regenerated.

By default, both directories point to the same location. You can separate them using [environment
variables][env-vars] for cleaner backup workflows.

## Configuration Directory {#config-directory}

The configuration directory holds user configuration and state. Everything here should be included
in [backups][backups].

| Platform | Default Location                          |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Windows  | `%APPDATA%\recyclarr`                     |
| Linux    | `~/.config/recyclarr`                     |
| MacOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/recyclarr` |
| Docker   | `/config`                                 |

Override with the [`RECYCLARR_CONFIG_DIR`][env-config] environment variable.

### Contents {#config-contents}

```txt
<config directory>/
├── recyclarr.yml
├── configs/
├── includes/
├── settings.yml
└── state/
```

## Data Directory {#data-directory}

The data directory holds ephemeral files that Recyclarr can regenerate on its own. These do not need
to be backed up.

If [`RECYCLARR_DATA_DIR`][env-data] is not set, data files are stored in the configuration directory
(the default behavior from prior versions).

### Contents {#data-contents}

```txt
<data directory>/
├── resources/
└── logs/
    └── cli/
```

## Default YAML Configuration Files {#default-yaml}

Configuration files may be located in multiple places, each documented in the sections that follow.
For all supported locations, the following behavior applies:

- All methods may be used together and all corresponding YAML files will be loaded.
- You don't have to use all locations; you can choose only the ones you want to use.
- If at least one configuration file is not found, it will result in an error.
- All YAML files must have the `yml` or `yaml` extension.

### File: `recyclarr.yml` {#recyclarr-yaml}

The default YAML configuration file is named `recyclarr.yml` and it is always located in the
configuration directory (listed above based on platform). Example (using docker path):

```txt
/config/recyclarr.yml
```

### Directory: `configs` {#config-directory-yaml}

Under the configuration directory, there is a subdirectory named `configs` in which you can place
any number of configuration YAML files. This system works especially well in Docker, where you don't
really have an easy way to specify custom CLI arguments. The following requirements must be met:

- All files must have the `.yml` or `.yaml` extension in order to be recognized.
- Every single YAML file placed here will be loaded as if every file were specified in the
  `--config` command line argument. This behavior is non-recursive; meaning if you place YAML files
  in subdirectories under `configs/`, they will not be loaded.
- The names of the files are unimportant and can be whatever you want.

:::caution

Include templates should *not* be placed here; use the [`includes`](#include-directory) directory
instead.
