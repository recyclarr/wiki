description: Using CF groups to sync curated bundles of custom formats
---

Custom format groups bundle related custom formats with guide-recommended scores. Instead of listing
dozens of individual custom formats, you reference a single group and get all the CFs that work
together.

## When to Use Groups {#when-to-use}

Use [`custom_format_groups`][cfg-ref] when you want to adopt curated sets of related custom formats
without managing each one individually.

Groups handle:

- Audio codec formats (TrueHD, DTS-HD, Atmos, etc.)
- HDR formats (DV, HDR10+, HDR10, etc.)
- Streaming service identification
- Unwanted release types (LQ, scene, etc.)

Use [`custom_formats`][cf] instead when you need fine-grained control, want to override scores, or
need to assign CFs to user-defined profiles.

[cfg-ref]: ../reference/configuration/custom-formats.mdx#custom-format-groups
[cf]: ../reference/configuration/custom-formats.mdx#custom-formats

## How Selection Works {#selection}

Which custom formats sync from a group depends on flags set in the TRaSH Guide JSON:

| Flag in Guide    | Behavior                                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `required: true` | Always synced. Cannot be deselected.                  |
| `default: true`  | Synced automatically. Can be overridden via `select`. |
| No flag          | NOT synced unless explicitly listed in `select`.      |

Most groups work without any `select` property—you get all required and default CFs automatically.

## Usage Patterns {#patterns}

### Sync All Required and Default CFs {#pattern-defaults}

For groups where you want the standard configuration, just reference the group:

```yml
custom_format_groups:
  - trash_id: 9d5acd8f1da78dfbae788182f7605200  # [Audio] Audio Formats
```

All required CFs sync unconditionally. All CFs marked `default: true` sync as well. Optional CFs
(those without a `default` flag) are skipped.

### Swap a Default for an Alternative {#pattern-swap}

Some groups contain mutually exclusive CFs where you should only use one. For example, a group might
default to "x265 (no 720/1080p)" but you prefer "x265 (HD)" instead:

```yml
custom_format_groups:
  - trash_id: ff204bbcecdd487d1cefcefdbf0c278d  # [Required] Golden Rule UHD
    select:
      - dc98083864ea246d05a42df0d05f81cc  # x265 (HD)
```

When you select a non-default CF from a mutually exclusive set, it replaces the default. You don't
need to explicitly remove the default—selecting an alternative handles it.

### Select Optional CFs {#pattern-optional}

Some groups have no defaults—every CF is optional. Use `select` to pick the ones you want:

```yml
custom_format_groups:
  - trash_id: 9337080378236ce4c0b183e35790d2a7  # [Optional] Miscellaneous
    select:
      - 7357cf5161efbf8c4d5d0c30b4815ee2  # Obfuscated
      - f537cf427b64c38c8e36298f657e4828  # Scene
```

Only the selected CFs sync. Required CFs (if any) still sync regardless of your selections.

## Finding Group IDs {#finding-ids}

Use the [`list custom-format-groups`][list-cfg] command to discover available groups and their
trash IDs:

```bash
recyclarr list custom-format-groups radarr
```

The output shows each group's name, trash ID, and the CFs it contains.
