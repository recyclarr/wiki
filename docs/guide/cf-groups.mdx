description: Using CF groups to sync curated bundles of custom formats
---

Custom format groups bundle related custom formats with guide-recommended scores. Instead of listing
dozens of individual custom formats, groups give you curated sets that work together.

## Auto-Sync with Guide-Backed Profiles {#auto-sync}

When you use a [guide-backed quality profile][guide-qp] (one with a `trash_id`), Recyclarr
automatically syncs CF groups that are marked as defaults for that profile. This means most users
need no `custom_format_groups` configuration at all.

For example, if you configure:

```yml
radarr:
  movies:
    quality_profiles:
      - trash_id: 64fb5f9858489bdac2af690e27c8f42f # UHD Bluray + WEB
```

Recyclarr automatically syncs default groups like Audio Formats, HDR Formats, and Golden Rule UHD
because the TRaSH Guide marks these as defaults for the UHD Bluray + WEB profile.

Use [`custom_format_groups`][cfg-ref] only when you need to customize this behavior:

- **`skip`** — Opt-out of groups you don't want
- **`add`** — Opt-in to non-default groups, or customize which CFs sync from a group

[guide-qp]: ../reference/configuration/quality-profiles.mdx#trash-id
[cfg-ref]: ../reference/configuration/custom-formats.mdx#custom-format-groups

## When to Use Groups vs Individual CFs {#when-to-use}

Groups handle curated sets of related custom formats:

- Audio codec formats (TrueHD, DTS-HD, Atmos, etc.)
- HDR formats (DV, HDR10+, HDR10, etc.)
- Streaming service identification
- Unwanted release types (LQ, scene, etc.)

Use [`custom_formats`][cf] instead when you need fine-grained control, want to override scores, or
need to assign CFs to user-defined profiles (those with only a `name`, not a `trash_id`).

[cf]: ../reference/configuration/custom-formats.mdx#custom-formats

## How CF Selection Works {#selection}

Which custom formats sync from a group depends on flags set in the TRaSH Guide JSON:

| Flag in Guide    | Behavior                                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `required: true` | Always synced. Cannot be deselected.                  |
| `default: true`  | Synced automatically. Can be overridden via `select`. |
| No flag          | NOT synced unless explicitly listed in `select`.      |

Most groups work without any `select` property—you get all required and default CFs automatically.

## Usage Patterns {#patterns}

### Opting Out of a Default Group {#pattern-skip}

If an auto-synced group doesn't fit your needs, use `skip` to exclude it:

```yml
custom_format_groups:
  skip:
    - 9d5acd8f1da78dfbae788182f7605200 # Audio Formats
```

The group won't sync even though your quality profile would normally include it.

### Adding a Non-Default Group {#pattern-add}

Some groups aren't marked as defaults but you may want them. Use `add` to opt-in:

```yml
custom_format_groups:
  add:
    - trash_id: f737e18b5824d6ebb2d57b957ae2fd6c # Streaming Services (UK)
```

All required and default CFs from that group sync automatically.

### Customizing Which CFs Sync {#pattern-select}

By default, groups sync all CFs marked `required` or `default` in the guide. Use `select` to
override this—only the CFs you list (plus any `required` CFs) will sync:

```yml
custom_format_groups:
  add:
    - trash_id: ff204bbcecdd487d1cefcefdbf0c278d # Golden Rule UHD
      select:
        - dc98083864ea246d05a42df0d05f81cc # x265 (HD)
```

Some groups contain CFs that aren't meant to be used together—you choose one or the other. The
guide picks one as the default, but you can override that choice. When you `select` a different CF
from these alternatives, it replaces the default that would otherwise sync. You don't need to
exclude the default manually.

### Selecting Optional CFs {#pattern-optional}

Some groups have no defaults—every CF is optional. Use `add` with `select` to pick the ones you
want:

```yml
custom_format_groups:
  add:
    - trash_id: 9337080378236ce4c0b183e35790d2a7 # Miscellaneous
      select:
        - 7357cf5161efbf8c4d5d0c30b4815ee2 # Obfuscated
        - f537cf427b64c38c8e36298f657e4828 # Scene
```

Only the selected CFs sync. Required CFs (if any) still sync regardless of your selections.

## Finding Group IDs {#finding-ids}

Use the [`list custom-format-groups`][list-cfg] command to discover available groups and their
trash IDs:

```bash
recyclarr list custom-format-groups radarr
```

The output shows each group's name, trash ID, and the CFs it contains.

[list-cfg]: ../cli/list/list-custom-format-groups.mdx
