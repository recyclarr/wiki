title: Backups

The following items should be preserved when backing up Recyclarr. All paths are relative to the
[configuration directory][config-dir].

- `recyclarr.yml`
- `settings.yml`
- `configs/*.yml`
- `includes/*.yml`
- `state/`

:::info

Be sure to include `*.yaml` in the above patterns as necessary. Both `yml` and `yaml` extensions
are accepted by Recyclarr.

:::

Files not listed above are regenerable and do not need to be backed up. If you use
[`RECYCLARR_DATA_DIR`][env-data] to separate ephemeral data (logs, resources) from configuration,
only the config directory needs backup.

[config-dir]: ./file-structure.mdx#config-directory
[env-data]: ../reference/env-vars.mdx#data-dir
