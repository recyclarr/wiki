```

## `service_type` {#service-type}

**Required.**

Must be one of `sonarr` or `radarr`. The service type will correspond to one of the more specific
sections later on. Each service type may be configured in different ways.

## `instance_name` {#instance-name}

**Required.**

A custom name used to identify this particular instance. This name must meet the following
requirements:

- Must contain only numbers, letters, and underscores (`_`).
- Must be unique across all other instances in your YAML config.

The purpose of the name is to be human readable and self-documenting. It is used in different ways:

- In log messages to more easily point out where issues are in your configuration.
- On the CLI, it allows executing actions against specific instances.

## `base_url` {#base-url}

**Required.**

The base URL of your instance. Basically this is the URL you bookmark to get to the front page. Must
begin with `http` or `https`.

:::tip

This property can be implicitly set via secrets if you follow a naming convention. See the
[Secrets][impliciturlkey] page for more details.

:::

:::warning

The `base_url` value is used to uniquely identify an instance of a service (such as Radarr). This
means that if you relocate your instances to a new URL (change of port, hostname, or path),
Recyclarr *will think this is a completely different instance*. This has implications with regards
to [caching].

:::

## `api_key` {#api-key}

**Required.**

The API key that Recyclarr should use to synchronize settings to your instance. You can obtain your
API key by going to `Settings > General` and copy & paste the "API Key" under the "Security"
group/header.
