The Recyclarr program utilizes YAML for its configuration files. The configuration can be set up
multiple ways, offering a lot of flexibility:

- You may use one or more YAML files simultaneously, allowing you to divide your configuration
  properties up in such a way that you can control what gets updated based on which files you
  specify.

- Each YAML file may have one or more service configurations. This means you can have one file
  define settings for Sonarr, Radarr, or both services. The program will only read the configuration
  from the file relevant for the specific service command you specified (e.g. `recyclarr sync
  sonarr` will only read the Sonarr config in the file, even if Radarr config is present).

  :::caution

  Even when running app-specific synchronization (e.g., `recyclarr sync radarr`), the entire
  configuration file must be free of syntax errors. While Recyclarr will ignore the configuration
  for services not being synced, it still validates the entire YAML file during parsing. This means
  errors in any section, even those for services not being synchronized, will cause the command to
  fail.

  :::

- Use [a `secrets.yml` file](/yaml/secrets-reference.mdx) to keep sensitive values out of your
  configuration files. This prevents accidentally sharing api_keys and other sensitive values when
  sharing configurations.

For various examples, see the [Configuration Examples] page.

[Configuration Examples]: /yaml/configuration-examples.mdx

:::tip Remember

If you do not specify the `--config` argument, the program will look for default configuration files
according to the rules documented on [the file structure](/file-structure.mdx#default-yaml) page.

:::info

Each main section of this reference page has a small table at the top which gives you a glance at
the feature's compatibility with every service supported by Recyclarr. The icons in that table are
documented below.

|                           Icon                           | Description           |
| :------------------------------------------------------: | --------------------- |
| <icon icon="mdi:check-bold" height="24" color="green" /> | Full Compatibility    |
|   <icon icon="mdi:tilde" height="24" color="yellow" />   | Partial Compatibility |
| <icon icon="mdi:close-thick" height="24" color="red" />  | No Compatibility      |
