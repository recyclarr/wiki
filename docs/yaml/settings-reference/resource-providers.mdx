---

Resource providers give you control over where Recyclarr gets its configuration data. Instead of
being locked into the official repositories, you can use custom forks, test branches, or even
multiple sources for different purposes.

## What Resource Providers Do

Resource providers determine where Recyclarr downloads essential data like:

- **Trash Guides**: Custom formats, quality settings, and naming schemes from the TRaSH community
- **Config Templates**: Pre-made YAML configurations for quick setup

By default, Recyclarr automatically uses the official repositories. You only need to configure
resource providers if you want to use custom sources.

## When You'd Use This

Common scenarios for configuring resource providers:

- **Custom modifications**: Use your own fork with personalized custom formats when you need to
  completely replace official sources
- **Supplemental content**: Add your own repository with additional custom formats alongside the
  automatic official sources
- **Offline setups**: Use local mirrors when internet access is restricted

## Quick Start

For most users, no configuration is needed. Recyclarr automatically includes official sources:

- **Official Trash Guides**: `https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git`
- **Official Config Templates**: `https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates.git`

:::info

Official repositories are always present automatically. You only need to configure resource
providers if you want to add supplemental sources or completely replace the official ones.

:::

If you want to add supplemental sources or replace the automatic defaults:

```yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/recyclarr/recyclarr/master/schemas/settings-schema.json

resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: official
      clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
      reference: master
  config_templates:
    - name: official
      clone_url: https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates.git
      reference: master
```

## Basic Configuration

### Replacing Official Sources

Replace the official trash guides entirely with your own fork:

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: official
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/custom-guides.git
      reference: main
```

:::warning

When you explicitly specify a repository with the name `official`, it completely replaces the
automatic official repository. The automatic official sources will no longer be used.

:::

### Adding Supplemental Sources

Add your own repository with custom content alongside the automatic official sources:

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: my-custom-formats
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/extra-formats.git
  config_templates:
    - name: my-templates
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/personal-templates.git
```

Recyclarr will automatically use the official Trash Guides and Config Templates repositories
plus your additional custom sources. All content is merged together.

## Repository Properties

Each repository supports these properties:

- `clone_url` *(Required)*<br/>
  A URL compatible with `git clone` that is used to clone the repository.

- `name` *(Required)*<br/>
  Unique identifier for this repository. Must contain only letters, numbers, hyphens, and
  underscores.

- `reference` *(Optional)*<br/>
  Branch name, tag, or commit SHA1 to check out. Defaults to the repository's default branch.

### Reference Examples

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    # Use a specific branch
    - name: development
      clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
      reference: dev-branch

    # Use a specific tag
    - name: stable
      clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
      reference: v2.1.0

    # Use a specific commit (full SHA1 or short form)
    - name: tested
      clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
      reference: c611e9df00bf9261bddfc749219295fe189ae552
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Repository Structure

When creating your own supplemental repository, organize it to match the structure used by the
official repositories. Refer to the official Trash Guides and Config Templates repositories for
the expected directory structure and file organization patterns.

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: my-formats
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/my-custom-formats.git
      reference: main
```

## Complete Example

Typical configuration adding supplemental content:

```yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/recyclarr/recyclarr/master/schemas/settings-schema.json

# Global settings
enable_ssl_certificate_validation: true

# Resource providers (official sources are automatic)
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: my-custom-formats
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/additional-formats.git
      reference: main

  config_templates:
    - name: my-templates
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/personal-configs.git
      reference: main
```

This configuration provides the automatic official Trash Guides and Config Templates plus your
additional custom formats and personal templates. All sources are merged together.

### Example: Complete Replacement

If you want to replace official sources entirely:

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: official
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/completely-custom-guides.git
      reference: main
```

:::warning

Using the name `official` replaces the automatic official repository entirely. Only do this if
your repository contains all the guides you need.

:::

## Migration from Legacy Repositories

:::info

The old `repositories` configuration is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

:::

### Old Format (Deprecated)

```yml
repositories:
  trash_guides:
    clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
    branch: master
    sha1: c611e9df00bf9261bddfc749219295fe189ae552
  config_templates:
    clone_url: https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates.git
    branch: master
```

### New Format

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: official
      clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
      reference: c611e9df00bf9261bddfc749219295fe189ae552
  config_templates:
    - name: official
      clone_url: https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates.git
      reference: master
```

### Key Changes

- **Multiple repositories**: Can now specify multiple sources per content type
- **Required naming**: Each repository needs a unique `name` identifier
- **Unified reference**: `reference` replaces both `branch` and `sha1` properties
- **Array format**: Each content type now accepts an array of repositories
- **Built-in defaults**: Official repositories are included automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Repository names must be unique

```yml
# Wrong - duplicate names
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: custom
      clone_url: https://github.com/user1/guides.git
    - name: custom  # Error: duplicate name
      clone_url: https://github.com/user2/guides.git

# Correct - unique names
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: custom-user1
      clone_url: https://github.com/user1/guides.git
    - name: custom-user2
      clone_url: https://github.com/user2/guides.git
```

#### Invalid characters in repository names

```yml
# Wrong - invalid characters
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: my custom repo  # Error: spaces not allowed
      clone_url: https://github.com/user/guides.git

# Correct - valid characters only
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: my-custom-repo
      clone_url: https://github.com/user/guides.git
```

**Git repository access issues**
If you get clone or authentication errors:

1. Verify the repository URL is correct and accessible
2. For private repositories, ensure your Git credentials are configured
3. Check that the specified branch/reference exists in the repository
4. Test the URL manually with `git clone [url]`

### Expected Results

After configuring resource providers:

1. Recyclarr will clone/update each repository to local storage
2. Multiple repositories for the same content type will be merged together
3. All configured sources will be available for custom formats, templates, etc.
4. Repositories with the same name will override each other (custom overrides official)

:::warning

Never edit files in the locally cloned repositories managed by Recyclarr! Local changes will be
destroyed when repositories are updated.
