Resource providers give you control over where Recyclarr gets its configuration data. Instead of
being locked into the official sources, you can use custom forks, test branches, or even
multiple sources for different purposes.

## What Resource Providers Do

Resource providers determine where Recyclarr gets essential data like:

- **Trash Guides**: Custom formats, quality settings, and naming schemes from the TRaSH community
- **Config Templates**: Pre-made YAML configurations for quick setup

By default, Recyclarr automatically uses the official sources. You only need to configure
resource providers if you want to use custom sources.

## When You'd Use This

Common scenarios for configuring resource providers:

- **Custom Modifications**: Use your own fork with personalized custom formats when you need
  specific modifications to the official guides. Perfect for users who want to experiment with
  modified configurations or have specific preferences that differ from the standard
  recommendations.

- **Supplemental Content**: Add your own repository with additional custom formats alongside the
  automatic official sources. This lets you use both official guides AND your custom additions
  without losing access to community updates.

- **Testing and Development**: Use development branches or specific commits for testing new custom
  formats before they're officially released. Ideal for users who want early access to new
  features.

- **Offline or Private Setups**: Use local mirrors or private repositories when internet access is
  restricted or when you need to ensure specific versions remain available.

## Quick Start

For most users, no configuration is needed. Recyclarr automatically includes official sources:

- **Official Trash Guides**: `https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git`
- **Official Config Templates**: `https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates.git`

:::info

Official repositories are included automatically unless you explicitly replace them by using the
name `official`. You only need to configure resource providers if you want to add supplemental
sources or completely replace the official ones.

:::

If you want to add supplemental sources alongside the automatic defaults:

```yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/recyclarr/recyclarr/master/schemas/settings-schema.json

resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: my-custom-formats
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/extra-formats.git
      reference: main
  config_templates:
    - name: my-templates
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/personal-templates.git
      reference: main
```

## How It Works

### Automatic Official Sources

By default, Recyclarr automatically includes:

- Official Trash Guides repository for custom formats, quality sizes, and naming schemes
- Official Config Templates repository for template configurations

These work without any configuration and are always available unless explicitly replaced.

### Adding Supplemental Sources

When you configure additional repositories with unique names, they're added alongside the official
sources. All content is merged together, giving you access to both official and custom data.

### Replacing Official Sources

If you name a repository `official`, it completely replaces the automatic official repository for
that content type. This gives you full control but removes access to automatic official updates.

:::warning

When you explicitly specify a repository with the name `official`, it completely replaces the
automatic official repository. The automatic official sources will no longer be used for that
content type.

## Configuration Reference

### Basic Structure

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: repository-name
      clone_url: https://github.com/user/repo.git
      reference: branch-or-tag-or-commit
  config_templates:
    - name: repository-name
      clone_url: https://github.com/user/repo.git
      reference: branch-or-tag-or-commit
```

### Repository Properties

Each repository supports these properties:

- `name` *(Required)*<br/>
  Unique identifier for this repository. Must contain only letters, numbers, hyphens, and
  underscores. Names must be unique within each content type.

- `clone_url` *(Required)*<br/>
  A URL compatible with `git clone` that is used to clone the repository.

- `reference` *(Optional)*<br/>
  Branch name, tag, or commit SHA to check out. **Defaults to `master`** (not the repository's
  default branch).

:::warning

The `reference` property defaults to `master`, not the repository's default branch. If your
repository uses `main` or another default branch, you must specify it explicitly.

:::

### Reference Examples

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    # Use a specific branch
    - name: development
      clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
      reference: dev-branch

    # Use a specific tag
    - name: stable
      clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
      reference: v2.1.0

    # Use a specific commit (full SHA or short form)
    - name: tested
      clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
      reference: c611e9df00bf9261bddfc749219295fe189ae552

    # Use main branch (must be explicit)
    - name: main-branch
      clone_url: https://github.com/user/custom-guides.git
      reference: main
```

## Common Use Cases

### Replacing Official Sources

Replace the official trash guides entirely with your own fork:

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: official  # This replaces the automatic official repository
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/custom-guides.git
      reference: main
```

:::warning

Using the name `official` replaces the automatic official repository entirely. Only do this if your
repository contains all the guides you need, or you'll lose access to official content.

:::

### Adding Supplemental Sources

Add your own repository with custom content alongside the automatic official sources:

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: my-custom-formats  # Unique name adds to official sources
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/extra-formats.git
      reference: main
  config_templates:
    - name: my-templates
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/personal-templates.git
      reference: main
```

Recyclarr will automatically use the official Trash Guides and Config Templates repositories plus
your additional custom sources. All content is merged together.

### Multiple Custom Sources

Use multiple repositories for different types of customizations:

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: personal-standards
      clone_url: https://github.com/user/my-media-standards.git
      reference: main
    - name: experimental
      clone_url: https://github.com/user/experimental-formats.git
      reference: test-branch
    - name: community-extras
      clone_url: https://github.com/community/additional-formats.git
      reference: v1.2.0
```

### Testing Specific Versions

Test specific commits or branches before using them in production:

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: official
      clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
      reference: c611e9df00bf9261bddfc749219295fe189ae552  # Specific tested commit
```

## Complete Examples

### Typical Configuration Adding Supplemental Content

```yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/recyclarr/recyclarr/master/schemas/settings-schema.json

# Global settings
enable_ssl_certificate_validation: true

# Resource providers (official sources are automatic)
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: my-custom-formats
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/additional-formats.git
      reference: main

  config_templates:
    - name: my-templates
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/personal-configs.git
      reference: main
```

This configuration provides the automatic official Trash Guides and Config Templates plus your
additional custom formats and personal templates. All sources are merged together.

### Complete Replacement Example

If you want to replace official sources entirely:

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: official  # Replaces automatic official repository
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/completely-custom-guides.git
      reference: main
  config_templates:
    - name: official  # Replaces automatic official repository
      clone_url: https://github.com/yourname/custom-templates.git
      reference: main
```

:::warning

Using the name `official` replaces the automatic official repository entirely. Only do this if your
repositories contain all the content you need.

:::

## Best Practices

### Repository Naming

- Use descriptive names that indicate the repository's purpose
- Avoid generic names like `custom` or `personal` if you might add multiple repositories
- Use consistent naming patterns if you have multiple custom repositories

### Reference Management

- Use specific tags or commits for your main setup to ensure stability
- Use branch names for testing new configurations
- Always specify `reference: main` if your repository uses `main` as the default branch

### Security Considerations

- Only use repositories you trust, as they can contain executable code
- Verify repository URLs carefully to avoid typos that could lead to malicious repositories
- Consider using specific commits rather than branches for maximum security

### Testing Changes

- Test custom repositories on a test setup before using on your main system
- Verify that your custom content follows the expected directory structure
- Check that custom formats are valid and work as expected

## Validation and Verification

### Verifying Configuration

After configuring resource providers, check that Recyclarr can access your repositories:

1. Run any Recyclarr command that downloads data (like `recyclarr sync`)
2. Check the logs for repository cloning/updating messages
3. Verify that custom content appears in list commands

### Expected Behavior

After configuring resource providers:

1. Recyclarr will clone/update each repository to local storage
2. Multiple repositories for the same content type will be merged together
3. All configured sources will be available for custom formats, templates, etc.
4. Repositories are processed in order, with official repositories having highest precedence

## Migration from Legacy Repositories

:::info

The old `repositories` configuration is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

:::

### Old Format (Deprecated)

```yml
repositories:
  trash_guides:
    clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
    branch: master
    sha1: c611e9df00bf9261bddfc749219295fe189ae552
  config_templates:
    clone_url: https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates.git
    branch: master
```

### New Format

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: official
      clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
      reference: c611e9df00bf9261bddfc749219295fe189ae552
  config_templates:
    - name: official
      clone_url: https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates.git
      reference: master
```

### Key Migration Changes

- **Multiple repositories**: Can now specify multiple sources per content type
- **Required naming**: Each repository needs a unique `name` identifier
- **Unified reference**: `reference` replaces both `branch` and `sha1` properties
- **Array format**: Each content type now accepts an array of repositories
- **Built-in defaults**: Official repositories are included automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Repository names must be unique

```yml
# Wrong - duplicate names
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: custom
      clone_url: https://github.com/user1/guides.git
    - name: custom  # Error: duplicate name
      clone_url: https://github.com/user2/guides.git

# Correct - unique names
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: custom-user1
      clone_url: https://github.com/user1/guides.git
    - name: custom-user2
      clone_url: https://github.com/user2/guides.git
```

#### Invalid characters in repository names

```yml
# Wrong - invalid characters
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: my custom repo  # Error: spaces not allowed
      clone_url: https://github.com/user/guides.git

# Correct - valid characters only
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: my-custom-repo
      clone_url: https://github.com/user/guides.git
```

#### Git repository access issues

If you get clone or authentication errors:

1. Verify the repository URL is correct and accessible
2. For private repositories, ensure your Git credentials are configured
3. Check that the specified branch/reference exists in the repository
4. Test the URL manually with `git clone [url]`

#### Wrong default branch

If you get errors about missing `master` branch:

1. Check your repository's actual default branch (often `main`)
2. Explicitly specify the correct branch in the `reference` property
3. Remember that `reference` defaults to `master`, not the repo's default branch

### Validation Steps

To verify your configuration is working:

1. **Check configuration syntax**: Run `recyclarr sync --dry-run` to validate YAML
2. **Verify repository access**: Look for clone/update messages in the logs
3. **Test content availability**: Use list commands to see if custom content appears
4. **Confirm merging**: Verify that both official and custom content are available

:::warning

Never edit files in the locally cloned repositories managed by Recyclarr! Local changes will be
destroyed when repositories are updated.
