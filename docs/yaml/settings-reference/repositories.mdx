title: Repositories (Deprecated)

:::warning

**This configuration format is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.**

Please migrate to [Resource Providers](./resource-providers.mdx) for the new, more flexible system.

:::

:::danger

Never edit files in the locally cloned git repositories managed by Recyclarr! Local changes in these
repositories will be destroyed!

:::

```yml
repositories:
  trash_guides:
      clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-/Guides.git
      branch: master
      sha1:
  config_templates:
      clone_url: https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates.git
      branch: master
      sha1:
```

## Supported Repositories

The `repositories` section contains a list of repositories to configure. Each repository *has the
same exact properties*, which are documented below. For example, `clone_url` is a valid property for
both `trash_guides`, `config_templates`, and any future repositories that may get added here.

List of supported repositories is below.

- [Trash Guides][trash_repo]: Contains the data synced to your Sonarr/Radarr instances.
- [Config Templates][template_repo]: Contains pre-made configuration YAML files used by the
  `recyclarr config` command.

[trash_repo]: https://github.com/TRaSH-/Guides
[template_repo]: https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates

## Per-Repository Properties

Default values *may be different* between different repositories for the same property. The example
YAML code block above shows the default values for corresponding properties documented below.

- `clone_url`<br/>
  A URL compatible with `git clone` that is used to clone the respective repository (listed above).
  This setting exists for enthusiasts that may want to instead have Recyclarr pull data from a fork
  instead of the official repository.

- `branch`<br/>
  The name of a branch to check out in the repository.

- `sha1`<br/>
  A SHA1 (commit hash) in Git to use (e.g. `c611e9df00bf9261bddfc749219295fe189ae552`). If
  specified, it overrides the `branch` setting. This SHA1 is passed to `git reset --hard` to force
  your local clone to this specific revision in the repository. If not specified, only the `branch`
  controls what revision is used in the repo.

## Migration to Resource Providers

The new [Resource Providers](./resource-providers.mdx) system replaces this deprecated format.
See the [v8.0 upgrade guide](../../upgrade-guide/v8.0.mdx#resource-providers) for complete
migration instructions.
