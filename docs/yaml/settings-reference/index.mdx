Settings are specified in a file named `settings.yml` in your [app data directory][app-data].
Settings in this file affect the behavior of Recyclarr regardless of instance-specific configuration
for Radarr and Sonarr.

Example of file location (using docker path):

```txt
/config/settings.yml
```

If this file does not exist, Recyclarr will create it for you. Starting out, this file will be empty
and default behavior will be used.

:::warning

There is absolutely no need to touch this file unless you have a specific reason to. It is
recommended that you only add the specific properties for the customizations you need and leave the
rest alone.

## Schema Validation {#schema}

Visit the [Schema Validation](/schema-validation.mdx) page for detailed instructions.

Add this comment to the top of your YAML file:

```yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/recyclarr/recyclarr/master/schemas/settings-schema.json
```

## Global Settings

```yml
enable_ssl_certificate_validation: true
git_path: /usr/local/bin/git
```

- `enable_ssl_certificate_validation` *(Default: `true`)*<br/>
  If set to `false`, SSL certificates are not validated. This is useful if you are connecting to a
  Sonarr or Radarr instance using `https` and it is set up with self-signed certificates. Note that
  disabling this setting is a **security risk** and should be avoided unless you are absolutely sure
  what you are doing.

- `git_path` *(Default: Search on `PATH`)*<br/>

  Provide an explicit path to your `git` executable. Note that this is a path to the actual
  executable itself and not a directory path. If this setting is not specified, Recyclarr will
  attempt to find `git` via your `PATH` environment variable.

## Resource Providers

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: official
      clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
      reference: master
  config_templates:
    - name: official
      clone_url: https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates.git
```

Resource providers control where Recyclarr downloads configuration data like custom formats and
templates. By default, official repositories are automatically included, so configuration is only
needed for custom sources.

See the [Resource Providers](./resource-providers.mdx) page for complete documentation.
