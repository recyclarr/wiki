These environment variables control Recyclarr's behavior across all commands.

:::tip Looking for config substitution?

To substitute environment variable values into your YAML configuration files, see [Value
Substitution][value-sub].

:::

## `RECYCLARR_CONFIG_DIR` {#config-dir}

Overrides the default [configuration directory][configdir] location. This directory holds user
configuration and state that should be backed up. See [File Structure][configdir] for platform
defaults and directory contents.

```bash
export RECYCLARR_CONFIG_DIR="/custom/path/to/config"
```

## `RECYCLARR_DATA_DIR` {#data-dir}

Overrides the location for ephemeral [data directory][datadir] used for regenerable files like
downloaded resources and logs.

```bash
export RECYCLARR_DATA_DIR="/custom/path/to/data"
```

If unset, defaults to the same path as `RECYCLARR_CONFIG_DIR`. When both variables are set, only the
config directory needs to be backed up.

Relative paths are resolved from the config directory.

## `NO_COLOR` {#no-color}

Disables ANSI color output when set to any non-empty value.

```bash
export NO_COLOR=1
```

Useful for scripting, piping output to files, or terminals that don't support colors.

See [no-color.org](https://no-color.org/) for more information about this standard convention.
