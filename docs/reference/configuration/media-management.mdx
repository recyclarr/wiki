<ServiceSupport sonarr="full" radarr="full" />

```yml
radarr:
  movies:
    base_url: http://localhost:7878
    api_key: !secret radarr_api_key

    media_management:
      propers_and_repacks: do_not_prefer
```

The `media_management` section configures settings found in **Settings > Media Management** in the
Sonarr/Radarr UI. If a property is not specified, Recyclarr will not sync that setting — this is
useful if you prefer to manage it manually.

## `propers_and_repacks` {#propers-and-repacks}

**Optional.** *Default: not synced*

Controls how Sonarr/Radarr handles Propers and Repacks. This corresponds to the "Propers and
Repacks" dropdown in the Media Management settings.

Valid values:

| Value                | Behavior                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `prefer_and_upgrade` | Prefer propers/repacks and automatically upgrade to them |
| `do_not_upgrade`     | Prefer propers/repacks but don't upgrade existing files  |
| `do_not_prefer`      | Don't give any preference to propers/repacks             |

:::tip

When using TRaSH Guides Custom Formats for repack/proper handling (the recommended approach), set
this to `do_not_prefer`. This disables the built-in handling so the Custom Format scores control
upgrade behavior instead.
