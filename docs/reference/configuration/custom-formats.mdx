## Synchronization Behavior {#synchronization}

Custom format synchronization is broken up into three categories:

- **Creation**: Custom formats that are in the guide but do not exist in the service are created.
- **Updates**: Custom formats that already exist in both the guide and the service *but are
  different* are updated.
- **Deletions**: If deletions are allowed by having the `delete_old_custom_formats` configuration
  setting set to `true`, then custom formats in the service are deleted if they are removed from the
  guide **or** removed from your configuration file.

:::info

Recyclarr will *never* touch custom formats that you create by hand, unless they share a name with a
custom format in the guide. In general, Recyclarr must have been the one to create a custom format
in order to do anything to it (update or delete).

:::

For details on how Recyclarr tracks custom formats it creates, see the [Cache] page.

[Cache]: /guide/troubleshooting/cache

## `delete_old_custom_formats` {#delete-old-custom-formats}

**Optional.** *Default: `false`*

If enabled, custom formats that you remove from your YAML configuration OR that are removed from the
guide will be deleted from your Radarr instance.

:::info

This *only* applies to custom formats that Recyclarr has synchronized to Radarr. Custom formats that
you have added manually in Radarr **will not be deleted** if you enable this setting.

:::

## `replace_existing_custom_formats` {#replace-existing-custom-formats}

**Optional.** *Default: `false`*

If enabled (set to `true`), custom formats matching the guide are always synced to the service,
replacing any existing CFs with the same name, whether you created them or not. This means that if
you manually create a CF from the guide and make adjustments to it, *those changes will be
overwritten*. If this property is omitted *or* you specify `false`, then Recyclarr will skip custom
formats that you've manually created from the guide. In other words, it will only touch custom
formats that it created to begin with.

## `custom_formats` {#custom-formats}

**Optional.** *Default: No custom formats are synced*

A list of one or more sets of custom formats each with an optional set of quality profiles names
that identify which quality profiles to assign the scores for those custom formats to. The child
properties documented below apply to each element of this list.

### `trash_ids` {#trash-ids}

**Required.**

A list of one or more Trash IDs of custom formats to synchronize. There are a couple of ways to
obtain Trash IDs (listed in order of preference below). The Trash ID itself is a hash of hexadecimal
characters, like `496f355514737f7d83bf7aa4d24f8169`.

- Most custom format pages in the TRaSH Guides (like [this one][guidecfs]) have either tables (with
  a Trash ID column) or a expandable "JSON" section. You can use these to obtain the Trash ID value.
- From Recyclarr itself using the [`list custom-formats` command][listcfs].
- Taken from the value of the `"trash_id"` property directly in the [TRaSH Guide JSON
  files][radarrjson] itself.

:::tip

To ease the readability concerns of using IDs, leave a comment beside the Trash ID in your
configuration so it can be easily identified later. If you use [`list custom-formats`][listcfs],
comments are added for you. For example:

```yml
trash_ids:
- 5d96ce331b98e077abb8ceb60553aa16 # dovi
- a570d4a0e56a2874b64e5bfa55202a1b # flac
```

:::

:::info A Few Things to Remember

- If `delete_old_custom_formats` is set to true, custom formats are **deleted** in Radarr if you
  remove them from this list.
- It's OK for the same custom format to exist in multiple lists of `trash_ids`. Recyclarr will only
  ever synchronize it once. Allowing it to be specified multiple times allows you to assign it to
  different profiles with different scores.

:::

### `assign_scores_to` {#assign-scores-to}

**Optional.** *Default: No quality profiles are changed*

One or more quality profiles to update with the scores from the custom formats listed above. Scores
are taken from the guide by default, with an option to override the score for all of them. Each
object in the list must use the properties below.

#### `name` {#qp-name}

**Required.**

The name of *an existing* quality profile. This name is **not required** to appear in the top-level
[`quality_profiles` list][qps]. If the profile name specified here does not exist, an error will be
shown. If you want this profile to be created by Recyclarr, you must also add an entry for it in the
previously mentioned `quality_profiles` list.

[qps]: ./quality-profiles.mdx

#### `score` {#qp-score}

**Optional.** *Default: Use scores from the guide*

A positive or negative number representing the score to apply to *all* custom formats listed in the
`trash_ids` list. A score of `0` is also acceptable, which effectively disables the custom formats
without having to delete them.
