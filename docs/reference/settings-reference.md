# Summary

Settings in this file affect the behavior of Recyclarr regardless of instance-specific configuration
for Radarr and Sonarr.

If this file does not exist, Recyclarr will create it for you. Starting out, this file will be empty
and default behavior will be used. There is absolutely no need to touch this file unless you have a
specific reason to. It is recommended that you only add the specific properties for the
customizations you need and leave the rest alone.

:::info

If you need to edit the file it is located according to the rules
documented on [the file structure](../file-structure.md#settings-yaml) page

:::

# Schema Validation

A schema file is provided for `settings.yml` to help assist in editing the file. To use it, simply
add the below snippet to the first line in your `settings.yml` file:

```yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/recyclarr/recyclarr/master/schemas/settings-schema.json
```

If you use VS Code to edit your settings file and install the [YAML extension][yaml], it will
suggest properties you can use and show you documentation for each without having to reference this
page.

## Global Settings

```yml
enable_ssl_certificate_validation: true
```

- `enable_ssl_certificate_validation`<br/>
  If set to `false`, SSL certificates are not validated. This is useful if you are connecting to a
  Sonarr or Radarr instance using `https` and it is set up with self-signed certificates. Note that
  disabling this setting is a **security risk** and should be avoided unless you are absolutely sure
  what you are doing.

## Repository Settings

**NOTE**: Never edit files in the locally cloned repo managed by Recyclarr. It will always destroy
local changes in that repository.

```yml
repository:
  clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-/Guides.git
  branch: master
  sha1: e27659e3f90d9b60c1f0b0f204b2530bb2299b41
```

- `clone_url` *(Default: `https://github.com/TRaSH-/Guides.git`)*<br/>
  A URL compatible with `git clone` that is used to clone the [Trash Guides
  repository][official_repo]. This setting exists for enthusiasts that may want to instead have
  Recyclarr pull data from a fork instead of the official repository.

- `branch` *(Default: `master`)*<br/>
  The name of a branch to check out in the repository.

- `sha1` *(Default: empty)*<br/>
  A SHA1 (commit hash) in Git to use. If specified, it overrides the `branch` setting. This SHA1 is
  passed to `git reset --hard` to force your local clone to this specific revision in the
  repository. If not specified, only the `branch` controls what revision is used in the repo.

## Log Janitor Settings

The log janitor is responsible for cleaning up logs generated by Recyclarr each time a command is
executed. These settings allow the user to alter the default cleanup behavior. For example, you may
want logs to be cleaned up sooner or keep log files around longer.

```yml
log_janitor:
  max_files: 20
```

- `max_files` *(Default: `20`)*<br/>
  The maximum number of log files to keep. If there are more log files than the max allowed here,
  Log Janitor will remove the oldest log files.
