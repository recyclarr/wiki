This version removes a few deprecated features. If you still use any of these features, action is
required to avoid errors next time you run Recyclarr.

## Removed Names Support for Custom Formats

Previously, you were allowed to specify names (instead of Trash IDs) in the `custom_formats` list:

```yml
custom_formats:
  - names:
      - 1080p
```

The `names` array has been removed and is no longer supported. Migrate your CFs (manually) to the
`trash_ids` list:

```yml
custom_formats:
  - trash_ids:
      - 820b09bb9acbfde9c35c71e0e565dad8 # 1080p
```

This migration is a manual process. You will need to use the output of the `--list-custom-formats`
CLI option and manually copy & paste the CFs you want.

## No Longer Load `recyclarr.yml` Sitting Next to Executable

The `recyclarr.yml` configuration file is no longer loaded if it's sitting next to where the
Recyclarr executable lives on the filesystem. From now on, the only valid (default) location for
this file is at the root of your [Application Data Directory][appdata].

[appdata]: ../file-structure.md#appdata-directory
