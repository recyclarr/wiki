:::info

**This version has not been released yet.**

To prevent information redundancy across upgrade guide pages, deprecation notices within Recyclarr
are systematically linked to the upgrade guide for the forthcoming unreleased major version. This
strategy serves as a living document that details all anticipated breaking changes, providing users
with adequate time to make necessary modifications prior to the implementation of these changes.

:::

Features have been removed *or* behavior changed. Most of the items here would have been deprecated
in the past. Deprecations are always mentioned in release notes for feature releases.

## Dedicated Includes Directory {#include-dir}

The root directory for relative local include paths has changed. Previously, relative paths provided
to the [`config` include directive](../yaml/config-reference/include.mdx#config) were rooted in
`${appdatadir}/configs`. Putting includes in the `configs` directory is no longer supported. Going
forward, all includes should reside in `${appdatadir}/includes`.

Migrating to the new directory is simple. Simply cut & paste any subdirectories containing include
template YAML files to the new `includes` subdirectory. Assume you have the current structure:

```txt
.
├── configs/
│   ├── config1.yml
│   ├── config2.yml
│   └── local/
│       ├── my-include1.yml
│       └── my-include2.yml
└── includes/
```

An empty top-level `includes` will be created for you by Recyclarr. In the example above, we need to
move the `local` directory to this top-level `includes` directory. The final structure should look
like this:

```txt
.
├── configs/
│   ├── config1.yml
│   └── config2.yml
└── includes/
    └── local/
        ├── my-include1.yml
        └── my-include2.yml
```

By doing this, the relative paths in your `templates` section does not need to change:

```yml
include:
  - config: local/my-include1.yml
  - config: local/my-include2.yml
```

### Recommended File Structure Changes (Optional) {#rec-structure-change}

If you followed the recommended file structure for your includes, then chances are you already have
a `configs/include` directory. To avoid having the path look weird, such as
`includes/include/my-include1.yml`, it is recommended that you remove the intermediate `include`
directory or rename it. For example, you could change this:

```yml
include:
  - config: include/my-include1.yml
  - config: include/my-include2.yml
```

To:

```yml
include:
  - config: my-include1.yml
  - config: my-include2.yml
```

And have your filesystem change from:

```txt
.
├── configs/
│   ├── config1.yml
│   └── config2.yml
└── includes/
    └── include/
        ├── my-include1.yml
        └── my-include2.yml
```

To this:

```txt
.
├── configs/
│   ├── config1.yml
│   └── config2.yml
└── includes/
    ├── my-include1.yml
    └── my-include2.yml
```

## YAML: Custom Formats `quality_profiles` Renamed {#assign-scores-to}

Prior to this major release, two `quality_profiles` nodes existed in YAML:

- The top-level version, which defined quality profiles to sync
- The one under `custom_formats`, which instructed Recyclarr which profile the CF scores should be
  synced to.

The fact that `quality_profiles` existed in two places with distinct meanings created a lot of
confusion, especially in support channels. Starting with this major release, `quality_profiles`
under `custom_formats` must be changed to `assign_scores_to`.

Before v8.0, if you had YAML like this:

```yml
radarr:
  movies:
    base_url: http://localhost:7878
    api_key: 123abc

    quality_profiles:
      - name: SD

    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          - ed38b889b31be83fda192888e2286d83 # BR-DISK
          - 90cedc1fea7ea5d11298bebd3d1d3223 # EVO (no WEBDL)
        quality_profiles:
          - name: HD-1080p
          - name: HD-720p
            score: -1000
      - trash_ids:
          - 496f355514737f7d83bf7aa4d24f8169 # TrueHD ATMOS
          - 2f22d89048b01681dde8afe203bf2e95 # DTS X
        quality_profiles:
          - name: SD
```

You are required to change it to this:

```yml
radarr:
  movies:
    base_url: http://localhost:7878
    api_key: 123abc

    quality_profiles:
      - name: SD

    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          - ed38b889b31be83fda192888e2286d83 # BR-DISK
          - 90cedc1fea7ea5d11298bebd3d1d3223 # EVO (no WEBDL)
        assign_scores_to: # <<< RENAMED
          - name: HD-1080p
          - name: HD-720p
            score: -1000
      - trash_ids:
          - 496f355514737f7d83bf7aa4d24f8169 # TrueHD ATMOS
          - 2f22d89048b01681dde8afe203bf2e95 # DTS X
        assign_scores_to: # <<< RENAMED
          - name: SD
```

Refer to the `RENAMED` comments in the above example for exact lines that changed.

## Settings: Repository Configuration Replaced {#resource-providers}

The legacy `repositories` configuration format has been completely removed and replaced with the new
`resource_providers` system. This change provides support for multiple repositories per content
type, cleaner configuration structure, and enables future support for non-Git resource access
mechanisms.

### Old Format (Removed)

```yml
repositories:
  trash_guides:
    clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
    branch: master
    sha1: c611e9df00bf9261bddfc749219295fe189ae552
  config_templates:
    clone_url: https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates.git
    branch: master
```

### New Format

```yml
resource_providers:
  trash_guides:
    - name: official
      clone_url: https://github.com/TRaSH-Guides/Guides.git
      reference: c611e9df00bf9261bddfc749219295fe189ae552
  config_templates:
    - name: official
      clone_url: https://github.com/recyclarr/config-templates.git
      reference: master
```

### Key Changes

- **Multiple repositories**: Each content type now accepts an array of repositories
- **Required naming**: Each repository needs a unique `name` identifier
- **Unified reference**: `reference` replaces both `branch` and `sha1` properties

### Migration Notes

- If you had no `repositories` configuration, no changes are needed - official sources are automatic
- If you customized official repositories via forks, you may now use supplemental resources instead
  of replacing official upstream repositories.

See the [Resource Providers](../yaml/settings-reference/resource-providers.mdx) documentation for
complete configuration details.
