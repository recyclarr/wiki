A directory named `includes` exists under the application data directory where local [include
templates][configdirective] may be placed. Any relative paths to include templates will start at
this directory.

For example, if I have the following include directive in a configuration file named `foo.yml`:

```yml
include:
  - config: bar/reusable.yml
```

The expected file structure of my `includes` directory would be visualized as follows:

```txt
.
├── configs/
│   └── foo.yml
└── includes/
    └── bar/
        └── reusable.yml
```

For more information about include templates, see the respective [behaviors page][include].

:::caution

Configuration files (non-includes) should *not* be placed here; use the [`configs`][configsdir]
directory for those.
